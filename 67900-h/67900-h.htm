<span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>A Saying of Garry Webster.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Kenyon</span> ate the good little German dinner
which the Berlin always served, and looked
amusedly out upon Broadway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently it&#8217;s the same old town,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;A little more light, a few more people;
but the same cocksureness, the same air of
being the goal of all human effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smile, he lay back in his chair and
watched the tide ebbing along. It was a
November night and the pulse of Broadway
beat heavily: the stream of life that flowed
through the great artery was as flippant and
as garish as a vaudeville. An orchestra was
drooning behind some palms in the Berlin; it
played one of those Indian things, filled with
the throb of tom-toms and unusual combinations
of tone.</p>

<p>But Kenyon listened inattentively. He ate
the last morsel of his dessert with satisfaction,
and drained the last drop of wine with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
appreciation; then he turned once more and
watched the crowds. It was the first time he
had been in New York in ten years; yet the
glare and effrontery of its big highway was
waking the fever of the city in his blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will there be anything else, sir?&#8221; asked
the precise German who had served him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the check,&#8221; answered Kenyon. He
felt for his card-case, after the waiter had
turned away; it held a single ten-dollar bill,
and this he regarded ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not much of a defence against the
aggressions of the world,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And
I fancy that this little dinner will put a rather
large-sized breach in it.&#8221; He turned the
check over gingerly. &#8220;Seven-fifty! Whew!
Why, that would have kept me half a lifetime
in Rio.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he stood up to be helped on with his
long top-coat. His dress clothes had been
made in Montevideo, but a good English tailor
had done the work, and they looked well
even under the searching eyes and lights of
the Berlin. But almost anything would have
looked well on Kenyon; he was of the tall,
wide-shouldered type that wear even shapeless
things with distinction.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Danke sch&ouml;n</i>,&#8221; said the waiter as he
slipped the coin handed him into his waistcoat
pocket, and gravely bowed his patron out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>Drawing on his gloves Kenyon leisurely
walked up Broadway. People turned and
glanced after him with curious eyes, for there
was always a sort of elegance in Kenyon&#8217;s
manner of dress that commanded attention.
But it was not alone the hang of a smoothly
fitting coat over the shapely, powerful figure;
there was the good-humored, good-looking
face, also an air of quiet distinction and
breeding; and then, stamped all over him, so
to speak, was the resolution that makes victors
of desperately circumstanced men.</p>

<p>No one, to look at him as he walked slowly
along, would have dreamed that this immaculate
creature had stood, only seven hours
before, stripped to the waist in the stoke-hole
of the British ship <i>Blenheim</i>. Yet it was so.
He had boarded her at Rio when she touched
there two weeks before; and though the fire-room
was no inviting prospect, still it was
better than Rio. A Latin-American city is
never a place for a penniless Gringo.</p>

<p>The section called the &#8220;Great White Way&#8221;
lay before Kenyon like a shimmering vortex.</p>

<p>&#8220;It screams like a phonograph,&#8221; pronounced
the young man, critically. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
just as ceaseless, as senseless, and as raucous.
This is the spot, I think, that old Colonel
Ainsleigh at West Point used to call a phosphorescent
ulcer. And it looks it. It&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
pride spot of the habitual New Yorker from
the small town&mdash;the money dump&mdash;the place
of cakes and ale.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he laughed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;I really think the Berlin&#8217;s dinner does not
set well on me,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;I once
liked New York very well. But it may be
that thirty is a great deal more than ten years
older than twenty. My taste for many things
has slackened in those ten years, and who
knows but what the big town has suffered
along with the other old likings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hard-worked hansoms and goblin-eyed
motor-cars spun along the smooth asphalt;
jeweled women and carefully attired men
streamed in at the light-flooded lobbies
of the theatres. Electric cars loaded with
pleasure seekers flashed clanging up and
down.</p>

<p>At Herald Square Kenyon paused. The
miraculous presses, turning out the pink-tinted
<i>Telegram</i>, held him fascinated. As
he stood there, the sharp staccato of a newsboy
began to reach him. At first he paid no
attention to the high-pitched, complaining
cry; but above the grind of cab wheels and the
thousand sounds of Broadway, it gradually
began to take shape in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Extree! Eight o&#8217;clock!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The thin voice pierced the air like a thing
with a point; and without actually being
aware of the burden of the cry, Kenyon began
to be annoyed by its abrupt dissonances.</p>

<p>&#8220;Full account! Great fortune! Extree!&#8221;</p>

<p>A great fortune! Kenyon was irritated by
the idea. One does not contemplate another&#8217;s
calm possession of a vast sum of money with
any great degree of equanimity when one has
but a few dingy dollars in the world.</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose this gold-fat fool has his
millions,&#8221; muttered the young man, as he
turned away from the windows. &#8220;That is
no reason why he should shatter the eardrums
of people as they pass about their
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Extree! Eight o&#8217;clock! Great fortune!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon beckoned the boy, and in a moment
he had a paper. Somehow, as he turned and
walked toward Thirty-sixth Street, the realization
suddenly came to him of how badly off
he was; and he scowled at the shadowy future,
a sudden, sobering fear at his heart. But this
was only for a moment. The man who had
stood at the side of Nunez on that last dreadful
night in Montevideo was not one to allow
a little ill-luck to cast him down; so with chin
up and shoulders squared, Kenyon threw the
thing from him with a laugh.</p>

<p>At the corner of Thirty-sixth Street he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
paused and opened the paper. In great, black
type the following stared at him:</p>

<p class="center">
WHO IS THE HEIR?<br />
<br />
$200,000,000!<br />
<br />
COLOSSAL FORTUNE OF STEPHEN AUSTIN<br />
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.</p>

<p>Kenyon did not read farther, but folded the
paper and stood tapping it thoughtfully in his
open palm.</p>

<p>&#8220;The human mind,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;can
scarcely grasp the meaning of such a sum.
And for one man to possess it all makes me
suspect that something is out of kelter with
our system of doing things. Here I am broke,
and with the prospect of a succession of dinnerless
days before me; and then here is
another fellow with tons of money and no
one to give it to. If I had the running of
things I&#8217;d take down the bars on some of the
fat pasture-land and let the lean cattle do a
little private grazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the opposite side of Broadway a hansom
was drawn up at the curb. Kenyon&#8217;s
eyes rested absently upon the veiled woman
who sat within it. He saw her speak a few
hasty words to the driver; then he noted the
man&#8217;s quick glance in his direction, and the
smart swish of the long whip over the roof
of the vehicle. The hansom rattled across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
street and drew up beside him; the woman
leaned forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was beginning to think that you had
failed us,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>A whimsical look came into Kenyon&#8217;s eyes;
then he smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; he began; but she interrupted
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite unnecessary,&#8221; she said. He
noted that the tone and the gesture that accompanied
the words were rather cold and
imperious. &#8220;I suppose,&#8221; she continued,
&#8220;that you did not know that he was ill; but,
even so, you should not have delayed. However,
it is not yet too late. The physicians
have assured us that he will live until morning&mdash;that
he may even get well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The whimsical look left Kenyon&#8217;s eyes and
with it went the smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Has there not been a mistake?&#8221; he asked,
gravely. But she gestured impatiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;The physicians are the best in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the coldness of the tone,
there was a certain sweetness in the voice that
attracted Kenyon; that she was a woman of
gentle breeding was very evident. And then
she was young!</p>

<p>Regretfully, he was about to inform her
that he was not the person she thought him
to be&mdash;that he was a stranger in New York&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he did not know a soul among its four
millions. But she stopped him once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The others are already there.&#8221; She made
room for him beside her, as she spoke. &#8220;Will
you get in? The matter must be adjusted
quickly if at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He noticed a quick flash of something like
indignation in this last sentence, and smiled.
She caught this and instantly her head went
up like that of an offended queen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take this occasion to say,&#8221; she said,
freezingly, &#8220;that I have considered his
safety, alone, from the beginning. My own
feelings do not enter into the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon, again,&#8221; began the
young man. &#8220;But the fact is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The small white hand went up once more
and waved back the words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that you are still in
time. However, it would have been much better
if you had come earlier. The ship reached
port some seven or eight hours ago; and there
could have been nothing to detain you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon bent his brows, and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>&#8220;What ship do you refer to?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Blenheim</i>,&#8221; came the prompt answer.
Her eyes were searching his face intently;
even the thick veil could not hide the fact that
they were big, dark, and lustrous. &#8220;That
was the ship, was it not?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;It was,&#8221; answered Kenyon, and the
puzzled look grew deeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is very low,&#8221; the girl continued, &#8220;and
he is very anxious to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A number of people stood about. Those
who overheard were beginning to stare; and
as this could not be endured, Kenyon entered
the hansom. Instantly the driver called to his
horse; the vehicle went rattling along Thirty-sixth
Street, heading east, and Kenyon settled
back by the girl&#8217;s side, smiling his astonishment
into the darkness.</p>

<small>THE DARK HOUSE IN SELDEN&#8217;S SQUARE</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">&#8220;When strange eyes peer through the veiling dark,</div>
<div class="indent3">Take care, my friend, take care!&#8221;</div>
</div></div>
<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>From the Doggerels of Balmacenso.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Kenyon&#8217;s idea, upon entering the
cab, to afford himself an opportunity, out
of earshot of the idlers, of bringing this
bizarre situation to an end. But as before
the girl gave him no chance.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you left Rio,&#8221; she began, in a
rather hesitating way, &#8220;you had but little
money, I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; smiled Kenyon, &#8220;is very true.&#8221;
And, for all the smile, he gazed at her searchingly.
For it was a very odd thing that she
should know so much about him. Within
fifteen minutes she had told him that he had
arrived on the <i>Blenheim</i>, that he had sailed
from Rio, and that he had been hard put for
money when he left there. But the thick veil
hid her face from him, and he turned his gaze
away, baffled.</p>

<p>In a few moments she spoke again; and
once more he detected the slight note of hesitancy
in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen Moritze &amp; Co.?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;Moritze &amp; Co.?&#8221; he repeated wonderingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; suddenly. &#8220;I had forgotten. Of
course you have not yet heard of them in connection
with this matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, no,&#8221; he admitted; &#8220;I must confess
that I have not heard of them in connection
with this matter; nor of anyone or anything
else having to do with it. It&#8217;s all a mystery
to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could you expect anything more, under
the circumstances?&#8221; She was fumbling in a
small handbag as she spoke. He watched her,
amazed at how the thing drifted on.</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not do to speak freely of some
things before all is ready,&#8221; she continued,
with a return of the cold manner of a few
moments before. &#8220;You should have learned
that while you were with Nunez.&#8221;</p>

<p>He caught his breath.</p>

<p>Nunez! She knew about that! And he had
not thought that any person north of Panama
knew of the part that he had played in that
ill-fated expedition in Uruguay. He was still
confusedly groping amid the mental haze
which her words had produced, when she
spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was entrusted with this and asked to
give it to you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>She placed a slip of crackling paper in his
hand; the cab lamps were too dim for him to
discern the figures, but a glance showed the
young man that it was a check.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he cried, hastily. &#8220;I cannot accept
this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? It is the exact sum that you
demanded.&#8221;</p>

<p>If there had been scorn in her voice before,
it now seemed to have increased a hundredfold;
and the undisguised contempt in her
manner showed her disbelief in him. This
was very evident to Kenyon; he was too
young to be indifferent to a woman&#8217;s scorn,
and a hot flush arose to his face. When he
spoke his voice was sharp and had a ring that
she had not heard before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason why I cannot take this is very
plain to myself, at least,&#8221; said he. &#8220;There
has been some mistake made. I am not the
man you take me to be!&#8221;</p>

<p>He saw her start at this, and peer at him
through the changing light. The veil seemed
to obstruct her vision and she flung it aside;
for the first time he saw her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dark,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;and beautiful. And
her eyes! Heavens! I never saw anything
like them before.&#8221;</p>

<p>And her head had a proud, youthful lift to
it that caught his attention instantly. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the sort of thing that he had always admired,
but had never seen so completely possessed
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; she said, coldly, &#8220;that I do
not quite understand. There can be no mistake.
You are the person for whom I was
sent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet you admit that you are just from
Rio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that you came in the <i>Blenheim</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you served with General Nunez in
Uruguay, did you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there is nothing wanting. You are
the man. But,&#8221; and the dark eyes flashed as
she spoke, &#8220;I hardly think, were the choice
of my making, that I should have fixed upon
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The continued scorn of her manner piqued
him. He was not accustomed to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; he questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. You resort to odd and useless evasions.
You do not speak straightforwardly.
You dodge the point at issue. You seem uncertain
as to whether you shall go on, or go
back. I expected, at least, to find a man of
firmness and decision.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>This aroused Kenyon. Youth, as a rule,
desires to show to good advantage before a
pretty woman. And to this he was no exception.</p>

<p>&#8220;You do me an injustice,&#8221; he said. He
spoke calmly, slowly, and evenly enough, but
there was heat behind the words. &#8220;If I have
shown any lack of decision it is because of
my natural reluctance to proceed farther in
this, to me, incomprehensible affair. I desire
to be honest, and have no wish to penetrate
deeper into a matter which cannot in the least
concern me.&#8221; He leaned toward her and continued.
&#8220;Once again I tell you that I am not
the man you take me to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>She drew back from him as far as the
limited space of the cab would permit, but
said nothing. He crackled the check paper
in his fingers, as he held it up and proceeded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This money is not for me. I cannot accept
it. I think you had better assure yourself
that all is right before going any
farther.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sudden anger filled her eyes, even in the
dimness he could see it glinting in amber
points. But her voice, when she spoke,
showed no trace of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What more can I do?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You
have satisfactorily answered every question
that I have asked.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;You might ask one more,&#8221; suggested
Kenyon, coolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My name.&#8221;</p>

<p>He could feel her searching his face with
those beautiful eyes once more. But there
was no doubt in them now; neither was there
any abatement of the anger that glowed in
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I ask your name?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I know it already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I question that,&#8221; said Kenyon, confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is written upon the check which you
hold in your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they passed a street lamp, Kenyon held
up the check so that the light would fall upon
it.</p>

<p>She had spoken the truth! In a cramped,
quavering hand he saw that it was drawn to
the order of Steele Kenyon!</p>

<p>Once more he settled heavily back against
the cushions of the cab. He was lost in astonishment.
But almost at the same instant the
vehicle pulled up and the apron was flung
open.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; remarked the girl, evenly, &#8220;if
you have made up your mind that everything
is right we will get out.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang down and helped her to alight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
It was an instinct that prompted him to do so,
however, for his mind was groping in a maze
of wonderment. The strangeness of the whole
incident was beating sluggishly in his brain;
and try as he would he could make nothing
of it.</p>

<p>She knew his name! She knew of Nunez, of
Rio, of everything. And, now, incredible as
it seemed, there was little doubt but what he
was actually the person wanted. He could
not intelligently grasp any part of it, and
with military abruptness ceased trying.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it work itself out as it will,&#8221; he muttered,
&#8220;I&#8217;ll not say another word in protest.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when the girl opened a heavy door with
a pass-key, he asked no questions; and when
she closed the door softly behind them, he
followed her down the wide, dimly lit hall
without a word.</p>

<p>The house was soundless. The girl opened
the door of a room off the hall; a single gas
jet burned lowly within; she motioned for him
to go in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please sit down,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You will
not be kept waiting long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even in the uncertain flicker of the low-turned
light, her way of carrying herself
pleased him. She was tall and straight, her
outlines were soft and womanly; and then
there was the proud lift of the head which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
he had noticed before. There was a suppleness
in her movements that one could not
help observing; but her air of youthful distinction
was what impressed Kenyon most of
all.</p>

<p>But there was no lessening of the scorn in
her manner; and as she made a movement as
though to leave the room, a sort of quick
regret flashed over him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow,&#8221; he murmured, after she had
gone, &#8220;I wish she had stayed. I&#8217;d like to be
better acquainted with her; I&#8217;d like to have
a chance to convince her that I don&#8217;t deserve
such treatment as she&#8217;s been giving me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down and stared at the door which
had closed upon her a moment before.</p>

<p>&#8220;An armor of ice, that&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t belong to her. I
could see a charm beneath it that she could
not hide. It showed itself when she spoke of
the person who is ill. And she&#8217;s beautiful.
Heavens, yes! She&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat broodingly for a moment or two;
then his thoughts reverted to the comedy in
which he was playing so odd a part, and his
humorous brown eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will ring in the second act before
long, I suppose,&#8221; he muttered, with a little
yawn. &#8220;And I have no doubt but what it will
bring the denouement as well.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>Some little time passed and Kenyon sat
patiently awaiting the outcome of his adventure.
But nothing occurred. The house remained
soundless.</p>

<p>In his thirty years of life he had gone
through many strange experiences, but for
sheer uniqueness this present adventure surpassed
them all. As he sat there in the semi-darkness
he began to marshal the facts
together.</p>

<p>After Nunez had been killed in that last
desperate stand in Montevideo, Kenyon had
fled north through Uruguay with Balmacenso,
and crossed the frontier into Rio Grande du
Sol. Then they made their way to Rio.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Balmacenso,&#8221; silently argued Kenyon,
&#8220;was the only man in Rio who knew my
identity; and Balmacenso died of a fever a
good two weeks before the <i>Blenheim</i> entered
port. He could not have sent word north
that I was going to sail in her; for at the time
of his death I had no intention of doing so&mdash;in
fact I had never heard of the ship before
she steamed up the harbor.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet here is this girl, and some others
whom I&#8217;m perhaps shortly to see, expecting
me, on that very ship. And apparently they
know of my connection with the revolt in
Uruguay; of my being flat broke in that God-deserted
hole, Rio; of my&mdash;but what&#8217;s the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
of rehearsing all their surprising knowledge.
I must go deeper into the affair before I can
understand any of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited patiently. The flickering point
of almost blue flame of the gas jet threw
an uncertain light in a confined radius about
where he sat; the remainder of the room was
shadowy and obscure. But his eyes gradually
became accustomed to the dimness of the
far corners; and little by little the consciousness
stole upon him that he was not alone.</p>

<p>Directly opposite, at a point where the
struggling light rays failed entirely to dispel
the shadows, he began to discern the outlines
of two human figures, indistinct, vague, but
constantly assuming more definite form as
his eyes searched them out.</p>

<p>Kenyon&#8217;s steady courage had been proven
a thousand times in the campaigns of Nunez
in South America; no matter what the stress
of the moment, or the unexpected nature of
the danger his brain always worked coolly
and smoothly. And now, though he began to
fear that he had been led into a trap, he remained
perfectly still. The two shapes in
the shadow sat with their backs to the wall
their faces turned toward him; he could now
and then catch the shifting glint of their eyes,
but they made no other movement.</p>

<p>For some little time Kenyon silently and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
coolly observed them. The house was as
soundless as before; nothing occurred that
gave him the least idea as to what to expect.</p>

<p>But, as no movement of any sort was made,
the thing became tiresome. As the girl did
not return, and as the two silent men in the
shadow made no sign, Kenyon resolved to
take the initiative himself. The gas jet was
within easy arm&#8217;s length; rising suddenly he
turned it on, full head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he remarked, bowing with a
graceful and easy politeness that was natural
to him, &#8220;a trifle more light, I think, would
make us better acquainted.&#8221;</p>

<small>IN THE FACE OF STRANGE DANGERS</small></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>Kenyon&#8217;s &#8220;Art of the Sabre.&#8221;</i></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of Kenyon&#8217;s nonchalant ease and
smiling face, his muscles were flexed for a
swift rush. But this never came; both men
arose and silently saluted him; then they resumed
their seats once more.</p>

<p>The puzzled expression that had come into
Kenyon&#8217;s eyes in the cab, returned. But in
that way only did he show it. His manner
was as easy as before; he leaned negligently
against a heavy table and smiled engagingly.
All the time, however, his keen glances and
rapid brain were gauging the quality of the
men with whom he had to deal.</p>

<p>With mild surprise he noted that the elder
of the two was a Chinaman, a tall, emaciated
man, with sunken, slanting eyes, hollowed
temples, and shaven crown. The straight,
thin, bloodless lips were drawn back, showing
the teeth; the wasted hands rested, claw-like,
upon the arms of his chair. As Kenyon
looked, the man coughed hollowly and raised
a handkerchief furtively to his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;Phthisis,&#8221; was Kenyon&#8217;s mental judgment.
&#8220;And about the most advanced stage
I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second was a huge, boyish, fresh-looking
youth, with an eager, smiling look, and
attired much after the fashion affected by
collegians of the younger sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he is a college man, he&#8217;s a guard on the
eleven, throws weights or does some other
equally hefty stunt,&#8221; Kenyon decided. &#8220;He&#8217;s
put together like a horse.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the two retained their silence;
they bent forward in their chairs and
carefully examined the graceful, immaculate
figure by the table. Then the Chinaman
spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be seated, Mr. Kenyon,&#8221; he said in a
husky, unpleasant voice. &#8220;Do not disturb
yourself in the least. We are quite delighted
to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more Kenyon bowed, laughingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it is all the same to you, I prefer to
stand,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And I think, gentlemen,
you may trust me to keep myself in a fairly
calm state of mind. As to your pleasure at
sight of me,&#8221; and his eyes twinkled humorously,
&#8220;permit me to say that you did not
appear in any great hurry to display it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Celestial&#8217;s lips drew back from his
prominent teeth in what was meant for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
smile; Kenyon, in spite of his self-control,
could not help a slight shudder. The almost
fleshless face, the shaven crown, and sunken
eyes made the man look like a death&#8217;s-head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust you will pardon our silence,&#8221; said
he, in slowly spoken, perfect English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray don&#8217;t speak of it,&#8221; returned Kenyon.
&#8220;Strangers sometimes find it extremely
difficult to pick material for conversation;
and I never take offence at any man&#8217;s shrinking
from the conversational idiocies of such
occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the yellow man smiled his ghastly
smile; but his companion laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said he, in the big-boyish way that
his looks had made Kenyon expect, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
got it right, Kenyon. I hate all that sort of
rot myself. When I talk, I like it straight
from the shoulder&mdash;I want it to mean something,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a hearty, engaging sort of candor
in his voice and manner common to the
big-bodied, out-door man. But still there was
an undercurrent of some inexplicable sort
that focussed Kenyon&#8217;s attention instantly
upon him. The frank smile was there, the
genial look that one would expect was in his
eye; the eager, boyish spirit seemed to fill
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s off-shade somewhere,&#8221; Kenyon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
told himself. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know just where; but
if I talk to him long enough I&#8217;ll get him located
and classed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinaman leaned forward, motioning
his companion to be silent. Instantly the
young man seemed to withdraw into himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;The yellow one is the intellect,&#8221; was Kenyon&#8217;s
thought as his alert glance took this in.
&#8220;And I shouldn&#8217;t wonder but what we were
now coming to business.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of the Chinaman fixed themselves
upon Kenyon&#8217;s face. Sunken and slanted as
they were usually, they presented a strange,
uncanny appearance; but now their lids were
puckered over them; and through each slit a
burning, rat-like eye looked forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this Western world, Mr. Kenyon,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;it is the conventional thing for
strangers, I understand, to discuss the
weather.&#8221; He bent forward and the burning
slits of eyes seemed to be boring the young
man through. &#8220;This being so,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;might I ask what sort of weather you were
having in Butte when you left there?&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was quietly asked; but Kenyon
instantly felt the weight of their intense
expectancy as though by telepathic messages.
Both the faces before him were now as expressionless
as plaster masks; with semi-fascinated
eyes he watched the twitching of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
one claw-like, yellow hand as it lay upon the
Chinaman&#8217;s knee. Nevertheless he did not
lose his poise for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was raining heavily when I left Butte,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Instantly the claw glided into the breast of
the yellow man&#8217;s coat; the boyish giant half
arose from his chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; continued Kenyon, with never a
trace of haste in his voice, &#8220;that was several
years ago, and I&#8217;m sure is of no interest
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the claw crept into view once more
and lay empty upon the arm of the chair;
slowly the big form of the younger man sank
back. Everything was as still as death. The
single gas jet threw quavering shadows about
the three. Kenyon still leaned easily against
the table, watching the others with speculative
eye.</p>

<p>Quick footsteps were heard to ring upon
the flags without. The room was at the front
of the house and street noises could be plainly
heard. The footsteps suddenly paused, then
ascended the stone steps. The hand of the
Chinaman instantly went up; a glance of intelligence
passed between him and his companion;
then both turned and nodded apologetically
to Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; and the Celestial jerked a thumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
toward the street, &#8220;is the person from Butte.
Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke there came a swift rush of feet
from without, a sharp, quick cry and the dull
beat of blows. Kenyon sprang toward the
door leading to the hall; but he found the
hands of the young white man against his
chest, and saw the fresh, good-humored face
looking into his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Steady, old fellow. Wait for the word.&#8221;
The speaker forced a smile. &#8220;There is no
cause for you to go off like this. Take my
word for it, whatever little matter is going on
outside there is for the good of everybody
concerned.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he spoke the sounds of the struggle
had ceased; the patter of softly running feet
was heard, then all was still again.</p>

<p>Kenyon stepped back and carefully arranged
his tie and the hang of his coat; for
the young giant had stopped him rather suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever you are,&#8221; remarked he, gently,
as he fastidiously smoothed off the traces of
their contact, &#8220;you appear to have a way with
you.&#8221; Then with a sudden sharpness in his
voice and an altered look in his face, he went
on, addressing both. &#8220;It seems to be taken
for granted that <i>I</i> am concerned in what is
happening here. Now, let me disabuse your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
minds upon that point. I&#8217;ve seen my share
of the broken points of life and have known
what it is to fight hard for small profits; but
my interests have never yet reached the stage
where I deemed it expedient to garrotte a
man in the darkness to serve them. Don&#8217;t
forget that fact, as we go along!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the Chinaman who replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will try not to,&#8221; said he in his husky
tones. He coughed hollowly and the handkerchief
went to his lips; that he had difficulty
in breathing was evident, but for all that, a
look of marked satisfaction was upon his face.
&#8220;We have made no mistake, my son,&#8221; addressing
his companion, &#8220;in selecting Mr.
Kenyon, it seems. He pleases me. It is not
often that one meets with a person quite so
much to one&#8217;s liking.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other man smiled cheerfully. &#8220;I never
saw the time, Hong, that you were not right,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;It takes you to pick the winners.&#8221;
There was unquestioned admiration in his
eyes as he turned to Kenyon. &#8220;You are the
man for the job. You seem to have a real
talent for this sort of thing. Good stuff! I
like your work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; returned Kenyon, dryly.
&#8220;You are very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s you, I&#8217;m glad to
know you,&#8221; said the big young man. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
shook hands with Kenyon in a hearty, whole-souled
fashion; there was honesty and good
intent in every line of his face. Kenyon&#8217;s
searching eyes were bent upon him; but if
ever there was candid, wide-open geniality it
was before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;This fellow,&#8221; he mentally admitted, &#8220;has
me winging. He seems right, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chinaman began to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well, I think,&#8221; said he to Kenyon,
&#8220;for you and Forrester to become well acquainted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forrester?&#8221; Kenyon turned a questioning
look upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;Forrester,&#8221; said the young
giant, rather impatiently. He looked the ex-lieutenant
of Nunez over very carefully for a
moment and then added: &#8220;Do you know, I
think that if you have any fault at all, Kenyon,
it is that you play the game too strong.
I am Forrester. You must have known
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon gestured gracefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sir,&#8221; said he, &#8220;there are a great
many things that I should know; nevertheless
a dense darkness seems to hedge them
around. If any light is to be thrown upon
this matter, I beg of you to turn it on now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said the Chinaman, approvingly.
&#8220;There is nothing in the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
like being positive&mdash;of knowing just with
what you have to do. But as things rest we
can tell you nothing. We know nothing, save
that I am Hong Yo, and that this,&#8221; pointing
to the other, &#8220;is Forrester.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon acknowledged this latter information
easily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am delighted,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I have no
doubt but what our acquaintance will lead to
some small matter of considerable interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the Chinaman, with another of
his hideous smiles, &#8220;it is sure to do that. But
we must be patient; we must wait. The next
step is yours to take; whatever the result, it
will be of your making.&#8221;</p>

<p>He coughed once more, with ominous hollowness;
then he seemed to settle down into
his chair and fall into a deep train of thought.
Kenyon felt Forrester quietly touch his
sleeve and turning found the young man at
his elbow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t pay any attention to him,&#8221; said
Forrester, nodding toward Hong Yo. &#8220;He
gets into those moods now and then. And, do
you know, it doesn&#8217;t pay to break into them.
He has rather a nasty temper; and then, too
he can think up the damnedest things you
ever heard of when he gets deep into it, that
way. You see,&#8221; guardedly, &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t stand
very well, and that sort of tells on him. He&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
the kind of a chap that likes to run things all
by himself. He didn&#8217;t care about letting me
into this, at all. But when it came to you, he
acted real nasty.&#8221; There was speculation in
his eye as he regarded the brooding Hong Yo,
and he continued: &#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me
a bit if he hasn&#8217;t been a sudden sort of a customer
in his day. He certainly has the look
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder,&#8221; said Kenyon.
&#8220;Then,&#8221; without a change of tone, &#8220;you have
not known him long?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not very,&#8221; with noticeable briefness.</p>

<p>There came a rustling of a gown outside
the door; then it opened and the girl re-entered.
For a moment as she looked at the
three occupants of the room there was appeal
in her eyes, a piteousness that made Kenyon&#8217;s
heart melt in his breast. And there were
red rims about the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been crying,&#8221; thought the young
man, and a fury seized him that anyone or
anything should cause her to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Forrester,&#8221; she said, &#8220;will you come
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice was sweet and soft with that
tremulous gentleness that so stirs a man.
But when she turned to Kenyon all this vanished;
the old hostile look returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, also, sir,&#8221; she said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV<br />


<small>KENYON IS DRAWN DEEPER INTO THE MAZE</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;A man should always strive to be at his best. He should<br />
never permit a girl to think meanly of him.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>A Remark of Garry Webster.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the ex-lieutenant of Nunez followed the
girl and Forrester from the room, he was both
pleased and resentful. The pleasure came
from the fact that he had judged correctly as
to the charming reality under the icy veneer.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all assumed,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;The
r&ocirc;le of the haughty, suspicious woman is but
a r&ocirc;le. Beneath it is a nature as sweet as one
could desire; I had a glimpse of it as she came
in; it was only a glimpse but it was enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>But why she wore this mask, and apparently
for his special benefit, he could not
understand. It was this that caused the resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything to merit it,&#8221; muttered
he. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first time she ever saw
me, and it&#8217;s not quite the right sort of thing
to take snap judgments that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo was left in the room below, still
seated in the chair by the wall and still deep
in thought. Indeed, he had scarcely raised
his head upon the girl&#8217;s entrance; however, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Kenyon was closing the door behind him,
he fancied that he caught a glimpse of the
sunken, slanting eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221; muttered the young adventurer,
shudderingly. &#8220;He&#8217;s more like a death&#8217;s-head
than ever! I don&#8217;t want to do anyone
an injustice, for I really <i>do</i> dislike snap judgments,
but if there is anything wrong here,
which there decidedly seems to be, why, our
friend Hong Yo is most intimately concerned
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both young men followed the girl up the
staircase and into a dimly lighted room upon
the second floor. An aged, white-bearded
man lay upon a bed; in a chair beside him
sat a tall girl with a great crown of golden
hair; she was pale-faced and anxious; her
attitude was watchful.</p>

<p>As they entered, the sick man struggled up;
the girl bent and whispered something to him,
and a look of joy came into his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome, my friends,&#8221; he said,
weakly. &#8220;And I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men bowed gravely, and then the old
man turned peeringly to Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, you have come at last! Welcome.
But pardon; I cannot see you very well. My
eyes are growing dim.&#8221;</p>

<p>He held out a shaking hand, and Kenyon
took it in his strong clasp.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sort of obsession,&#8221; Kenyon told
himself, as he alternately looked at the sick
man and those at his bedside. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know these people. I&#8217;ve never seen any of
them before to-night, and they can&#8217;t possibly
know me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And yet the supreme confidence of them all
seemed to assure him that he was wrong. It
was as though, in some odd way, a page had
been torn from the book of his life&mdash;a page in
which these characters had played a part, and
which he had completely forgotten.</p>

<p>The weak old man exercised the same effect
upon him as the check. He felt that he could
not undertake another step in the matter until
all had been made clear to him. To go groping
forward in this way was distasteful, dishonest,
criminal! Turning an irresolute look
upon the others, he caught the dark, steadfast
eyes of the girl of the hansom cab. His face
flushed hotly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hesitating idiot she must think
me,&#8221; he muttered, angrily. &#8220;She expects me
to go ahead. So go ahead I will!&#8221;</p>

<p>The touch of his hand seemed somehow to
give the old man strength.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity,&#8221; he said, waveringly, &#8220;that
Nunez should not have lived. Ah, his was the
brain to plan; his was the daring spirit to
lead.&#8221; Then, eagerly, &#8220;Tell me of his end.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;He died like a soldier,&#8221; answered Kenyon,
gravely. &#8220;He held Montevideo as long
as courage and skill could hold it; and when
he went down, it was in the center of the
plaza, with his face to the enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>With difficulty the old man struggled to an
upright position.</p>

<p>&#8220;In an hour,&#8221; said he, whisperingly, &#8220;I
too, shall be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a sharp cry the golden-haired girl
sank upon her knees beside the bed; the other
bent over the old man, whispering soothingly,
her eyes full of unshed tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; continued the sick man, gently.
&#8220;Dear hearts, you might as well know it now
as later.&#8221; He placed a hand upon each of
their heads, a world of tenderness in the
caress. &#8220;And the bitterest thing about it all
is that I may leave you both unprotected&mdash;perhaps
in as great danger as <i>he</i> will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon noted the emphasis and wondered
who it was that was referred to. No one
spoke for a moment; a small clock in another
room ticked high and sharply; the noises
from the street seemed strangely muffled. It
was Forrester who spoke first; hesitatingly
he moved nearer to the bed; there was the
subdued, boyish eagerness in his manner that
Kenyon had observed before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna at least shall not be left unprotected,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
said he. &#8220;All here know my love
for her. I want her for my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The golden-haired girl raised her face and
her eyes spoke eloquently to him. Kenyon
drew in a great, satisfied breath and felt a
glow of interest flush him from head to foot.</p>

<p>Then they were lovers, these two! That
was excellent! He was pleased. Indeed, he
doubted if he had ever seen a better matched
couple before. The strongest desire in his
mind was to reach over, take Forrester by the
hand, and wish him success&mdash;heartily, earnestly,
fully. For, somehow, the gentle greeting
which the other girl had given Forrester
in the room below, had excited a sort of disapproval
in Kenyon&#8217;s mind; and it was something
strikingly like relief that now went
shocking and beating in his blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the sick man to Forrester.
&#8220;You love her; but whether she shall ever be
your wife depends upon yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ready to prove myself worthy of her&mdash;ready
to do anything that a man may do,&#8221;
said Forrester.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything?&#8221;</p>

<p>A shadow settled upon the young man&#8217;s
eager face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said anything that a man may do,&#8221; said
he, and there was a catch of indecision in his
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>&#8220;This matter needs a man that is not only
strong and brave, but one that has a ready
wit. For the service that I desire, rendered
fully and unquestioningly, a man may command
anything that is in my power to give.&#8221;</p>

<p>The shadow upon Forrester&#8217;s face grew
deeper; the eyes that he turned upon Anna
were dumbly piteous, like those of a dog.
Then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;You require violence,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and to
me that is a thing of fear; it seems to draw a
red curtain before my eyes; the very thought
of it brings to me the thick scent of blood. It
is a horror that I have had from birth. But
outside all this, I am opposed to force. I
could not lift my hand against the life of a
fellow man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what the cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter what the cause. The sacred
law says: &#8216;Thou shalt not kill.&#8217; And the law
of my physical nature tells me that I must
obey.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence followed this, save only for Anna&#8217;s
sobbing. Kenyon looked at the speaker in
keen surprise. He was thinking of the sharp
cry and muffled blows of a half hour before
and of Forrester&#8217;s preventing him from leaping
to the rescue of the person attacked.</p>

<p>&#8220;And unless my recollection is badly at
fault,&#8221; thought Kenyon, &#8220;this same young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
gentleman was settling himself to do for me
when our friend Hong Yo asked me the question
about Butte, and the first half of my
answer led them to think that I was lately
from there. His present highly moral attitude
hardly agrees with all that, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a long silence, during which the sick
man labored painfully for breath, he spoke
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel convinced,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;that
you are sincere. But that is not the point.
To win this girl for your wife you must stand
a friend to <i>him</i>. His designs must be your
designs. You must stand or fall with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forrester&#8217;s face was one of agony, but he
shook his head; there was no sign of wavering
in his manner. The dark-eyed girl was regarding
him with wondering, puzzled eyes;
but it was Anna who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Griscom,&#8221; she said, and the piteous little
tremble in her voice would have shaken a man
of granite, &#8220;you are breaking my heart. Will
you not surrender one mite of principle for
my sake?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Forrester was proof even against this;
and though he turned away his face, apparently
unable to look into her eyes, his voice
was still decided.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; not even for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the girl&#8217;s head sank once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
and the great sobs shook her young body like
a storm. Forrester&#8217;s determination seemed
to have its effect upon the old man also. It
was clear that he had staked much upon the
young giant, and had not expected this tenacious
grip upon an idea that he, more than
likely, did not altogether understand. And
the disappointment told heavily upon the
dregs of vitality left him; his chest seemed to
sink, his face grew grayer. When he spoke
his voice was lower than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You, Mr. Kenyon, have seen stern work,
and have no such childish prejudices against
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon felt the dark eyes upon him, though
he did not turn to see, and he answered
promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not. Indeed, I have seen much
good result from it&mdash;at times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent! If you are half the man
Nunez told me you were, long ago, you will
serve me well. I thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then turning to the girls he said, weakly:</p>

<p>&#8220;My children, arise!&#8221;</p>

<p>Both girls arose to their feet obediently
and the old man continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always loved you both. That you
know well. But many times I have regretted
that you were not young men, that you might
take upon yourselves the struggle that is to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
come. But I see now that it is all for the
best. I am glad that you are what you are;
for in you I see the triumph of my desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the faces of Forrester and Anna, Kenyon
read amazement at these words. But the
face of the other girl did not change.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is a man,&#8221; and the old man indicated
Forrester, &#8220;who knows every step I
would have taken to safeguard him of whom
you all know. And here,&#8221; indicating Kenyon,
&#8220;is one of unquestioned courage, of
ready resource, of coolness in the face of
danger. Combined they will form a defence
which even the most secret and deadly
machinations would find difficult in breaking
down. You, Griscom, have asked Anna of me
in marriage; and you,&#8221; to Kenyon, &#8220;have
asked for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>His hand, as he spoke, rested upon that of
the girl of the hansom cab. Kenyon gasped
and stood staring in wonder. This was the
most astonishing of a series of astonishing
things; and his amazement was so great that
he could not have protested had his desire to
do so been ever so great.</p>

<p>And, to speak the plain truth, the desire
to do so did not even exist. There was a
magic for him in that brilliant, proud face
and imperiously uplifted head. Why, if he
could&mdash;but he halted the idea instantly, crushing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
it down without ruth. No, no. That sort
of thing would not do. He must not allow such
fancies to get possession of him. Soldiering
in South America is not very profitable employment,
but it, at least, teaches a man to
avoid ways that are perilous; and in the way
to this beautiful unknown&#8217;s love lay pain and
heart-burning. He could read that in each
glance of her eye and each movement of her
supple, exquisite figure.</p>

<p>These thoughts occupied but a few seconds&#8217;
time, and Kenyon was about following where
they led when he was arrested by a gesture
which the old man made to the two girls.
They seemed to understand, and each raised
her right hand; the fair-haired one was
choked with sobs; the other proud and cold-eyed
and looking unflinchingly into Kenyon&#8217;s
face. Then the sick man spoke in the panting,
broken way of a man who had run a long
race; and the girls repeated the words after
him without hesitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I solemnly swear that I will willingly become
the wife of,&#8221; here one spoke Forrester&#8217;s
name and the other Kenyon&#8217;s, &#8220;but not until
he has performed the service of which he
knows.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they finished the old man reached the
end of his strength. A deep purple ring
showed about his mouth, his head hung limply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
to one side. His iron will was still unbroken,
for he managed to gasp out:</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, it is for you to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>But death killed the speech in his mouth.
And as the two girls sank sobbing beside him,
Forrester took two quick strides to Kenyon&#8217;s
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick, now,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;Everything
is ready. Your share of this work will stand
no delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that he all but forced the adventurer
from the room and down the stairs.
In another moment Kenyon found himself
upon the outer steps with the door closed
behind him, and all about him the clustering
shadows of the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite an interesting night,&#8221; he said,
coolly. &#8220;I had no idea that there was so
much gratis entertainment in New York. It
is really hospitable. Here a lonely stranger
arrives in town; and immediately he is taken
in hand and provided with diversion of an
absolutely unique character. The thing is an
inspiration.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked down the steps, and stood by the
railing that ran along the front, gazing up at
the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;At some future time,&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;I
might have a desire to know just where to
find this abode of marvels. The number is
ninety-eight, and the street,&#8221; looking across
the way at a corner light, &#8220;is Selden&#8217;s
Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>He made a note of both. The arc lamps
hissed and clicked in the silence; from away
to the west came the throb of Broadway; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
badly blended voices of some belated roisterers
rose in quavering dissonance; the strip
of sky that showed between the roof tops was
black and starless.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was just about the top step, I fancy,&#8221;
said Kenyon, &#8220;that the man from Butte was
received so warmly.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke a man appeared, apparently,
from the shadows at his feet. With a sharp
side-drive of the elbow Kenyon landed him
heavily against the railing; then he stood
calmly posed before him ready for the next
move.</p>

<p>The man pulled himself together and
chuckled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the punch with you, all right,
pal,&#8221; remarked he. &#8220;But don&#8217;t cut it loose
on my account. I&#8217;m not dealing with you on
those lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you should change your style of
dawning on the scene,&#8221; observed Kenyon,
dryly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the sort of thing that&#8217;s calculated
to get you into several varieties of
trouble; for from a short distance it has
rather a rugged look. But now that you are
here, what <i>do</i> you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to make my get-away in a hurry,&#8221;
returned the man. &#8220;But first I&#8217;d like to say
that it&#8217;s the &#8216;Far East&#8217; for a guy like you.
Do you get me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>And with that he turned and made softly
away, clinging to the shadows, and at last
disappearing around a corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;The motions of a panther and the manners
of a yeggman,&#8221; spoke Kenyon. &#8220;A
most undesirable person to come upon, unprepared,
I should say.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and made his way westward,
deep in thought. He walked with bent head,
and did not notice a patrolman well along in
the block who looked at him searchingly and
suspiciously; but he was allowed to pass without
interference.</p>

<p>A bell from a neighboring tower solemnly
boomed two as he turned into Fifth Avenue
and made his way down town. The night had
turned chill and damp; he turned up the collar
of his overcoat with a shiver and plunged his
hands into the wide pockets. As he strode
along he drew deeply at the cigar which he
had lighted, until the end glowed redly.</p>

<p>When Kenyon smoked hard it was a positive
indication of mental unrest. Against the
high-colored background of surprise, suspicion
and possible crime with which the night
had daubed his thoughts, was thrown a brilliant
face and a pair of flashing, scornful
eyes.</p>

<p>Who was she? Who were they? And
what was the mysterious thing which so held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and so moved them all? But more than anything
else, how, in the name of all that was
bizarre and astonishing, did he come to be
mixed up in it? No matter what side of the
matter he set himself to consider, he always
came back to this particular one. It was a
thing absolutely beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p>For a good two hours he tramped the
streets smoking and thinking. If the girl
had not figured in the affair it would have had
but little effect upon him; he was quite well
accustomed to startling occurrences, but her
participation troubled him. Otherwise he
could have gone comfortably to bed and forgotten
it all.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is something decidedly wrong in
Selden&#8217;s Square,&#8221; muttered he, &#8220;something
that&#8217;s off color and underhand. But what is
it? And how does a girl like that&mdash;but she
can have nothing to do with anything that&#8217;s
not correct. I am positive of that. There is
something fine and high about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just how he ever came to be walking along
the North River front he never knew. He
was so deep in conjecture that he had given
no heed to where his steps had been leading
him, and about four o&#8217;clock he found himself
in the neighborhood of the Twenty-third
Street ferry. Even this he would not have
known had he not suddenly collided with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
stoutly built young man, with fiery red hair,
who was just about entering a railroad cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; cried this person, sharply. &#8220;Have
the goodness to look where you are going,
will you? It&#8217;s all right and proper, my
friend, to carry as much excess as you can
comfortably handle. But don&#8217;t try to shoulder
any of it upon a man who has traveled
much and is very tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said Kenyon, stiffly.</p>

<p>The countenance of the other, in the ruddy
flare of the cab lamps, suddenly expanded
into a delighted grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, dog-bust it, it&#8217;s Kenyon!&#8221; he almost
shouted. &#8220;Shake!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Garry Webster!&#8221; Kenyon gripped the
extended hand, equally delighted. &#8220;Why, old
boy, this <i>is</i> a surprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster shook Kenyon&#8217;s hand with the
utmost vigor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, who would ever have thought to
meet you here,&#8221; cried he. &#8220;It&#8217;s been all of
ten years since I saw you last, Ken, and a
good five since I heard from you; and here
you all but knock the breath out of me before
I&#8217;m in New York ten minutes. But I thought
you were doing stunts in South America with
a machine gun and a backing of barefooted
patriots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I was, until a few weeks ago, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>&#8220;Hold on, tell me about it later. Pile in
here,&#8221; drawing him toward the cab door;
&#8220;kick those bags and things out of the way.
I&#8217;m for the Waldorf, and the biggest breakfast
they&#8217;ve got in the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>A feeling of faintness in the stomach told
Kenyon that breakfast was a thing that he
stood rather in need of himself. So he got
into the cab with Webster and they bore down
upon the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just in from Chicago,&#8221; the red-haired
young man told Kenyon, &#8220;going to look into
the windings of the hardware business here,
and see if we can&#8217;t corral some of the trade
that has been lately taken from us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still traveling for Webster &amp; Seybold,
eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, no!&#8221; laughed Garry. &#8220;The
governor took me into the firm three years
ago. This is my first business trip since, and
I wouldn&#8217;t be making it, only it&#8217;s something
special. You see, a rival concern has been
cutting into our eastern trade like sixty, and
something had to be done about it. And as I
am the only one in the shop that is sufficiently
acquainted with this market, why, it was me
to get busy with my trunks. Back there
somewhere, in a freight shed, I&#8217;ve got about a
dozen sample cases filled with the finest steel
implements and sundries ever seen east of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
Pittsburg. They are the limit, and no mistake.
Webster &amp; Seybold are out after the
business of this section; and, as I block things
out, when I&#8217;ve covered the ground, the entire
harvest will be reaped and bound. I don&#8217;t
intend to leave those other fellows opening
enough to put in a pound of wire nails.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster so laughed and choked and shook
over this ideal if exaggerated prospect, that
Kenyon, also laughing, was forced to pound
him upon the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t changed much, Garry,&#8221; remarked
Kenyon. &#8220;You still like to slap your
own choice of color on the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there is no use in letting them put
up some other shade for me, you know.
They&#8217;d only turn out a job that wouldn&#8217;t suit.
Paint the future in a good, cheerful hue, Ken,
and she&#8217;ll never come to you in mourning. I
made that discovery years ago, and have
always stuck to the bright shades. No browns
or grays for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But sometimes they get on of themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go &#8217;long! It couldn&#8217;t happen, no matter
how you take it. A man is always master of
his future.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not always. Sometimes things happen
over which he has no control&mdash;for example
the things which happened to me last night.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>&#8220;I can see a story in your eye. You have
had an adventure.&#8221; Webster laughed and
cocked up his feet. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have it, Ken, for
your stories are always sure to have lots of
go in them. But, hold on. Wait till we get
to the hotel and start in on the breakfast. I&#8217;ll
enjoy it better.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the Waldorf-Astoria, Garry engaged a
magnificent suite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Webster &amp; Seybold are going to do the
thing right,&#8221; remarked he, as he walked about
and approvingly surveyed the very evident
elegance of the apartments. &#8220;Hardware men
like to eat costly food and absorb colored
drinks. Here is where they can do both; they
can dine and sup and luncheon and breakfast
to slow music and rapid propositions. And
always will your humble servant be directly
in the focus of the spot-light, reaching them
the talk. Right off the dining-room is the
sample-room. Do you get the effect? When
they are feeling pleasant and comfortable and
&#8216;old chappy,&#8217; I&#8217;ll pilot them in there and they
will buy as they never bought before. A man
in good humor cannot possibly resist the line
I will show him. And it will be instant
delivery and ninety days&#8217; time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You</i> have no thought of failure in your
campaign, Garry,&#8221; remarked Kenyon, rather
soberly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;Failure! No! No man with the goods
ever fails. It&#8217;s only the poor devils who try
to win out with high prices, hard terms, and
empty hands. Proper equipment is the thing
that gains commercial battles as well as military
ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s true. And other sorts as
well, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Without a doubt.&#8221; Garry gazed at his
friend curiously for a moment; then he said:
&#8220;Somehow, Ken, you give me the impression
of being in deep water. Has it anything to
do with the night&#8217;s adventure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has all to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! The experiences of these modern
Babylons! I have had my own share of
them; but as a rule I sort of slough them off
before many hours have passed. It&#8217;s quite
the best way. But here&#8217;s the breakfast.&#8221;</p>

<p>They ate in a small room, overlooking Fifth
Avenue; and during the progress of the meal,
Kenyon related his experiences of the preceding
night. Webster listened with the
utmost attention and many exclamations.
When Kenyon had finished he lay back in his
chair and fairly rocked with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Adventures to the adventurous!&#8221; cried
he. &#8220;Why, old chap, it&#8217;s like a night of our
ancient friend, Haroun Al Raschid.&#8221; He
bent forward and continued with great interest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
&#8220;And so the dark-eyed girl was beautiful,
was she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Charming! Superb! I never saw anything
just like her before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the indications are,&#8221; said Webster,
carefully inspecting his friend, &#8220;that you
never will again. It&#8217;s the sort of thing that
only hits one once in a lifetime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By all means. But that&#8217;s not going to
alter anything. And you say she was cold,
scornful, imperious, and all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but only to me. To everyone else
she spoke gently; and it was at such moments
that I got a glimpse of her true charm. Why,
even this fellow Forrester came in for a share
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? According to your account of
him, he must be rather an attractive kind of a
chap, just the sort that is apt to be strong
with women.&#8221;</p>

<p>Garry witnessed with unholy joy the resentment
that flushed Kenyon&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t I tell you that he&#8217;s in love with
this other girl, and she with him. And then
he&#8217;s not at all the sort of fellow that such a
girl would admire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; said he. He lit a
cigarette and lay back in his chair, smoking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
thoughtfully. At last he said: &#8220;But, aside
from her, this is a peculiar experience. It&#8217;s
a great deal like a dream. There is something
so absolutely lawless about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can make neither head nor tail of it,&#8221;
said Kenyon. &#8220;However, to tell the candid
truth, I have examined but one side of the
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Webster, with a nod.
&#8220;You&#8217;re confiding in an old pal, Ken, so don&#8217;t
be backward. It&#8217;s the girl.&#8221; Kenyon was
silent, so the young man from Chicago proceeded.
&#8220;Of course it is. You have been
kept so busy trying to free her of any possible
blame that you have been unable to see anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are right,&#8221; replied the other,
quietly. &#8220;She impressed me as being
strangely out of place in such an atmosphere.
There was courage and goodness and high
purpose in her every look and movement.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221; Webster instantly dropped his
bantering manner at Kenyon&#8217;s quiet, unembarrassed
tone. His experience with the
other told him that anything which his friend
took seriously was not to be treated lightly.
Throwing away his cigarette end, he lighted a
fresh one. &#8220;I can&#8217;t think properly unless
I&#8217;m continually firing up,&#8221; explained he.</p>

<p>He drew quickly and deeply, and the thick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
blue smoke formed a veil between him and
Kenyon. Then, waving it away with his
hand, he proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now let us take this little affair from
the very start. I suppose you have been
doing that ever since it happened; but if we
are to get at anything tangible in the way of a
solution we must do it once more. Let me
play the grand inquisitor; I probably see the
entire adventure from a different angle than
you, and will, perhaps, set your mind to working
upon points that all but escaped you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Kenyon, lighting a cigarette
also. &#8220;Go ahead, Garry; and I hope you
make a better fist of it than I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, to start with: Did you get no whisper,
in any way, of the name of the old man
that died last night in Selden&#8217;s Square?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the faintest. Nor that of the girl I
have specially spoken of. The other&#8217;s name
was Anna. Then, of course, there was Forrester
and Hong Yo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the old man knew Nunez, your old
commander in Uruguay. There is a possible
clue. Did you never hear Nunez speak of
any friends who lived here in the North?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; Webster pursed up his lips
and blew a long, thin stream of smoke toward
the ceiling. &#8220;That seems conclusive enough.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
We&#8217;ll never get at anything from that direction,
that&#8217;s sure. But let us come to yourself
now. You&#8217;ll know more about that subject.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure to,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were your intimates while in Montevideo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew no one intimately save Nunez and
his secretary, Balmacenso.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Nunez was killed at the taking of the
town by the forces of the dictator.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Balmacenso? What sort of a fellow
was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bad sort of a chap. I think he was
a Spaniard. He saved my life after the fight,
packed me on a mule, I being unable to walk
because of a wrenched leg. If you fancy he
had anything to do with this thing you are
on the wrong scent. These people expected
me on the <i>Blenheim</i>. Balmacenso died weeks
before the <i>Blenheim</i> entered port and at a
time when I had no notion of coming North in
her. I&#8217;ve gone over all that, but there is no
explanation of the mystery in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster looked baffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here,&#8221; complained he, &#8220;don&#8217;t
throw cold water upon my investigation like
this. It&#8217;s discouraging. Here I&#8217;m sweating
like a sheep, trying to get to the bottom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
this thing, and you take a sort of delight in
stumping me. It&#8217;s not friendly and it&#8217;s not
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; laughed Kenyon.
&#8220;I&#8217;m only tickled to see how similar your own
point of view is to my own, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem as widely separated as I
expected them to be, that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; admitted
Garry. &#8220;It proves to me that it is possible
for a man, newly impressed by a most beautiful
woman, to see as clearly as the most cold-blooded
of his friends. And that is a thing
worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled genially across the table at Kenyon
and smoked his cigarette contentedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There remains only one other thing which
I can think of,&#8221; said he. &#8220;And that is the
possibility of there being persons who knew
you in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no one,&#8221; said Kenyon, positively.
&#8220;I never knew but a few people here,
and them only slightly&mdash;so slightly as not
even to recall their names. And no one in
the North knew of my movements in recent
years&mdash;not even you. And that I was coming
to New York was not known to myself more
than two hours before I started.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is deeply and blackly mysterious,&#8221; conceded
Webster. &#8220;It would require an acute
intellect of the highest type to do anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
with it. One thing I can see very plainly, and
that is that hardware is my line, and not
conundrums.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied that you would give it up,&#8221; said
Kenyon, smilingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only temporarily. I&#8217;ll grapple with it
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apart from the oddness of the matter
where I am personally concerned,&#8221; said Kenyon,
seriously, &#8220;is the matter where it concerns
others. What are these people, and
what object have they in view?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hong Yo, now, did not impress you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was like a bloodless snake. I chilled
at the very sight of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the other&mdash;the hammer-throwing
chap&mdash;sort of puzzled you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Candidly, yes. He was boyish frankness
personified, but still&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have your doubts. Exactly. We are
all more or less strong believers in the adage
that birds of a feather flock together. But
the old man? What of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot make up my mind. He spoke of
a mysterious purpose of which I was supposed
to be acquainted, as I told you, and
of a mysterious person who was to be safeguarded.
And he was intensely and passionately
in earnest. Whatever it is, it was of
tremendous moment to him.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>&#8220;Then there is Forrester&#8217;s whispered injunction
to you at the end; also the garrotting
of the stranger from Butte outside the door.
I tell you, Ken, you have had a night of it,
and no mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment both were silent. They
smoked thoughtfully and the corners of their
eyes were gathered in tight little lines. Suddenly
the cigarette dropped from Kenyon&#8217;s
hand, and he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Webster, in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only the check,&#8221; answered the other,
ironically. &#8220;What confounded stupidity! I
never thought to look whose signature was
attached to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holy Smoke!&#8221; ejaculated Webster. And
he sat regarding his friend with bulging eyes.</p>

<p>Kenyon drew the check from his pocket and
opened it; he gave it a single glance, and then
sank back in his chair, disappointment in
every line of his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is signed by Hong Yo,&#8221; he said.</p>

where there were other travelers also.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Amazing Adventures of Mansour Bi.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two young men sat regarding one another,
vexedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now was there ever such an aggravating
thing before,&#8221; cried Webster, at last. &#8220;I felt
sure that it would contain the old man&#8217;s
name, and that our guessing was at an end.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the check from Kenyon&#8217;s hand and
inspected it closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he whistled. &#8220;Your services
are placed at a pretty high figure, Kenyon.
This calls for as many as ten thousand dollars.
Apparently the parties whom you visited
last night are not at all stinted for
money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks that way, to be sure,&#8221; answered
Kenyon, dryly. &#8220;And upon second thought
we may glean some information from the
check, after all. The bank will surely know
something of Hong Yo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unquestionably. But will they tell it to
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely not. Banks are rather disposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to be noncommittal, I have found. But
I can call there and inquire, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moritze &amp; Co.,&#8221; read Webster thoughtfully,
still examining the check. &#8220;Somehow
it seems to me that I&#8217;ve heard of that house
before.&#8221; He pondered awhile, then suddenly
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I have it. It&#8217;s a Seattle concern, and
is much favored by the Pacific trade&mdash;steamship
companies, exporters, and the like. Webster
&amp; Seybold have done business through
them; they have branches in Hong Kong and
Tokio, and the Orientals seem to rely greatly
upon them.&#8221; He handed the slip of paper
back to Kenyon and inquired: &#8220;But what are
you going to do with this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a puzzle,&#8221; returned Kenyon. &#8220;Of
course the thing&#8217;s not mine. Perhaps the
best thing for me to do would be to pay
another visit to 98 Selden&#8217;s Square, make a
brief, vigorous statement of facts, and wash
my hands of the whole affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really want to do that last?&#8221;
asked Webster, with a shrewd look.</p>

<p>Kenyon colored; but his embarrassment
was only of a moment&#8217;s duration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure that I do,&#8221; he answered,
quietly. &#8220;The adventure is not without
its interest. And then there is the girl.
I rather fancy that the desire to see her once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
more will begin to grow upon me shortly; and
I&#8217;m also of the opinion that I shall not put
up much of a fight against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoken like a courageous and candid
soul,&#8221; laughed Webster. &#8220;Stick to it; don&#8217;t
be beaten. If she&#8217;s anything like your limning
of her, she&#8217;s worth some sort of an
effort.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a little while Kenyon arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get some sleep,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I begin
to feel a bit tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you stopping? Why not make
a shift here, where we can keep in touch with
each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m putting up at a clean little German
place down town; in fact it&#8217;s very much down
town. I can see the trees of Battery Park
from my window.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re broke,&#8221; stated Webster, firmly.</p>

<p>Kenyon gestured his admission of the
charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otherwise, why the job in the stoke-hole
of the <i>Blenheim</i> on my way up?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Webster assumed the countenance of delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, by all that&#8217;s providential,&#8221; he cried,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got you, at last. When we were at
college and I&#8217;d go down the line, scattering
my change, you&#8217;d lend me yours in a fatherly,
patronizing way that was peculiarly aggravating.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
And this is my first chance to get
back; I&#8217;ve never caught you broke before.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lit a third cigarette and grinned widely.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much do you want?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;How strong a jolt can you stand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I entered the firm of Webster &amp;
Seybold, I&#8217;ve planted something like fifty
thousand dollars. What part of it do you
want, Ken? I&#8217;ll cut it anywhere you say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy, Garry!&#8221; Kenyon looked at his
friend with smiling eyes; but the corners of
his mouth, usually so firm, twitched a little.
&#8220;A couple of hundred will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster regarded him disgustedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, behave,&#8221; said he. &#8220;This isn&#8217;t a
dime-saving fund. If you want to hit the institution
at all, you must do it big.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s down and out,&#8221; thought the young
man from Chicago, &#8220;and a man in that shape
needs a fair-sized dose if it&#8217;s to do him any
good at all.&#8221; Then he said aloud. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you what I&#8217;ll do in the way of a compromise.
We&#8217;ll make it two thousand, and not a damned
cent less.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon protested, but the other was firm.
&#8220;It&#8217;s just like this,&#8221; continued the latter,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a reputation to uphold; and I can&#8217;t
afford, for business reasons, to have my
friends live over German beer saloons in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
neighborhood of the Battery. Webster &amp;
Seybold are above such things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon slept deeply all that day. Darkness
was already thickening above the city
when he climbed out of bed and began to
douse himself with a huge sponge dipped in
a pail of cold water.</p>

<p>&#8220;A dollar a day hotel doesn&#8217;t offer many
conveniences,&#8221; said he, trying to keep his
teeth from chattering. &#8220;But, then, I&#8217;ve seen
more limited accommodations for the morning&mdash;or
evening&mdash;bath, in more pretentious
places. It was always a dreadful question
with me whether my fellow strugglers for liberty
in Uruguay ever bathed or no.&#8221;</p>

<p>He donned his dress clothes and took a cab
to the Waldorf, where he had engaged to dine
with Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do the thing with all proper ceremony
to-night,&#8221; said the latter, &#8220;for it is
probably our last chance. I&#8217;ve made arrangements
for the first hardware dinner; it&#8217;s
to come off to-morrow night and is to be followed
by a long succession of others. They
all fall for it, Ken; there is something about
free food and champagne that men past middle
age just can&#8217;t resist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the samples all ready?&#8221; asked Kenyon,
as they made their way among the tables
in the glittering restaurant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>&#8220;They came this afternoon; and I&#8217;ve had
two men unpacking at top speed ever since.
You never saw such a brave display of useful
goods in your life. There will be a riot when
the trade gets its first look.&#8221;</p>

<p>The restaurant was fairly well filled; and
as the two passed along on their way to a
secluded nook, Kenyon&#8217;s air of elegant distinction
as usual attracted much attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;A short fellow with red hair could never
do it,&#8221; mused Webster, as he became aware
of this. &#8220;How Providence does dump its
gifts at the feet of some people.&#8221;</p>

<p>A low exclamation drew his attention
swiftly to a table quite near the one they had
selected; he saw a woman in a sombre motoring
dress draw a thick, dark veil about her
face; a man who sat at the table with her was
regarding her with obvious surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked the man as Webster
passed.</p>

<p>But the woman placed her hand upon his
arm in a gesture that asked for silence; and
all the time her gaze was fixed upon the two,
who were by this time some yards away.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">ALL THE TIME HER GAZE WAS FIXED UPON THE TWO</p>

<p>&#8220;You can order for me, too,&#8221; said Webster.
&#8220;I have the utmost confidence in your
taste. Meantime, I&#8217;ll watch a small comedy
which is going on behind you. No, no,&#8221;
hastily, &#8220;don&#8217;t look around, because it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
struck me as being just a little queer, and I
want to see the finish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed and said, &#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s a matter of interest, I depend
upon you to keep me posted.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he gave his attention to the selection
of the dinner, while Webster, with a
great assumption of carelessness, watched the
couple to whom his attention had been drawn
a few moments before.</p>

<p>They had the appearance of having stopped
during a motoring journey, for dinner; for
the man, too, wore the costume affected by
that cult. But they, apparently, had lost all
interest in the meal; they bent toward each
other and conversed in low, eager tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s telling him something, and it&#8217;s
about us,&#8221; thought Garry. &#8220;And, by George,
doesn&#8217;t he seem pleased to hear it, though.
I never saw a man&#8217;s face light up so much
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued to give the couple his attention
while Kenyon gave his orders to the
waiter; after the man had gone he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Kenyon, do you know that we
seemed to startle that young woman as we
came in. Now, don&#8217;t look around, I tell you,&#8221;
sharply. &#8220;They are not yet aware that I&#8217;ve
noticed them, and I&#8217;d rather they wouldn&#8217;t
be.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>&#8220;Startled her, did you say?&#8221; Kenyon
leaned toward the other, and his eyes narrowed
expectantly. &#8220;What does she look
like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not have a chance to see. She drew
her veil instantly upon sight of us; and it&#8217;s
really the most competent veil I ever saw. It
hides her completely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is elderly. His head is half bald and
he has craggy, prominent features. I wouldn&#8217;t
like to be positive, but from this distance he
seems to have the coldest and most vulture-like
eye I ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A most interesting person, indeed,&#8221;
smiled Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Interested, you mean. If you don&#8217;t feel
his eyes boring through your back, you are
absolutely without that sense. He seems upon
the point of devouring you. I can&#8217;t make out
just how the girl is taking it, not being able to
see her face; but it&#8217;s what she is saying that&#8217;s
exciting her companion and causing him to
radiate so. They must be people who know
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you this morning, that I knew no
one in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You made some acquaintances last
night,&#8221; said Webster, meaningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man is not one of them.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>&#8220;How about the woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Kenyon&#8217;s eyes narrowed; there were
little puckers about their corners.</p>

<p>&#8220;About her I cannot say.&#8221; He paused for
a moment, and then asked, eagerly: &#8220;What
is the color of her hair. Is she light or
dark?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The veil conceals everything, and she
holds it in place in a way that plainly shows
that she intends it to go on doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>When their dinner began to arrive Webster
took his eyes from the pair for a few moments;
and when he looked up again they
had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I really thought they were good for
an hour,&#8221; said the young Chicagoan. &#8220;It
does not seem possible that their interest
could slacken enough in that time to permit of
their going away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon did not reply, but sat staring
moodily before him. He had maintained this
attitude for some time before Webster noticed
it; and then the latter grew suddenly
silent.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the girl,&#8221; he told himself. &#8220;Poor
chap! She&#8217;s got him, whoever she is. He&#8217;ll
never see a woman in the distance again without
thinking it&#8217;s she; nor he&#8217;ll never see another
sun arise without thinking that it&#8217;s
going to witness his meeting with her. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
is, not for a while. It&#8217;s comforting to think
that such things don&#8217;t last long.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had reached this stage in his reflection
when a boy approached.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenyon?&#8221; inquired he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Webster. &#8220;Here, wake up,
old chap; there&#8217;s a message for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From a man who just left in an automobile,&#8221;
the boy informed Kenyon, as he
handed him the message. &#8220;He said there
was no answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon tore open the envelope. The note
was written upon a sheet of hotel stationery,
and contained but two lines of writing. A
glance took this in, and with a laugh he tossed
it over to Webster. The message read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&#8220;Your progress is wonderful! But don&#8217;t forget
that boldness can be carried too far.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>And underneath this was the signature:
&#8220;Farbush.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE BELLEVUE HOSPITAL PUZZLE</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;Do you know, old chap, there are many features in this<br />
case that I do not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>A Frequent Remark of Garry Webster.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Mr. Farbush</span>,&#8221; remarked Garry Webster,
speculatively, &#8220;is more than likely the gentleman
with the half-bald head and the vulture
eyes. But just where does he enter in this
thing, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no telling,&#8221; answered Kenyon.
&#8220;It is not well to introduce all one&#8217;s characters
in the first act, as every practical dramatist
knows. Farbush has been held in reserve
for the opening of act second, apparently;
which reservation shows the hand of a craftsman
of more or less skill.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the speaker&#8217;s voice
that caught Webster&#8217;s attention, and he gave
him a quick, inquiring glance. It seemed to
hold a certain resolution that was not altogether
clear.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the appearance of Mr. Farbush has any
connection with your adventure of last night,
it is more like the climax of an old, rather
than the opening of a new, act,&#8221; said Garry,
slowly. &#8220;Where is your dramatist going to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
get his material to go on with his work?
Surely not from the actions of a man eating
his dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not intend to continue eating indefinitely,&#8221;
smiled Kenyon. He looked at
his watch and continued: &#8220;An hour from
now will find me in Selden&#8217;s Square and ringing
the bell at 98.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; said Webster, &#8220;I see. You intend
to return the check.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not only that, but I intend to put a stop
to the whole matter. Why, the thing has
grown absurd. I&#8217;m not accustomed to this
sort of dealing; and the quicker it&#8217;s over and
done the more comfortable I shall feel.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had finished, Webster said: &#8220;A
cab will take us there in less than a half
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Us?&#8221; repeated Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Us.</i> Why, to be sure. You don&#8217;t suppose
I intend to let you go alone, do you?
Well, hardly! Another thing. Come up to
my rooms for a moment before we start.&#8221;</p>

<p>An elevator whirled them upward; and in a
few moments the young man from Chicago
was opening a revolver case in his sample
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Colt,&#8221; said he, calmly, holding the
weapon up for his friend&#8217;s inspection. &#8220;Dull
metal, forty-five calibre; has a barrel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
assures accuracy and a grip that is a real
grip. It&#8217;ll make quite a bulge in your pocket,
but then it will also shoot a hole through a
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For a humdrum man of trade, Garry, you
have lots of romance left in you,&#8221; said Kenyon.
He took the revolver and spun it
around, a forefinger through the trigger
guard. &#8220;You intend that an armed force
shall move on Selden&#8217;s Square, I see. But
where is your ammunition?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; and Webster handed him a dozen
or more long cartridges.</p>

<p>Two revolvers were loaded and shoved
deep into overcoat pockets; then the two descended
to the street, got into a cab and were
driven to Selden&#8217;s Square.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a very live street, for so early an
hour,&#8221; remarked Webster, as they alighted
at the corner and walked slowly along.</p>

<p>&#8220;I noticed that last night,&#8221; returned Kenyon,
somewhat grimly. &#8220;The thugs who attacked
the man outside of 98 did not seem
to have any fear of interruption.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, you did not see anything of
the attacked one when you came out, did
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; those who committed the assault
either carried him away, or the police found
him before I came out.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>They had reached 98 by this time and
halted. It was gloomy and deserted looking;
not a glimmer of light was to be seen at any
of the windows. They ascended the steps and
Kenyon pulled the old-fashioned bell-handle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking of policemen,&#8221; remarked Webster,
in a low tone, &#8220;that looks like one across
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gleam of the helmet plate and shield
were unmistakable; but their owner made no
move toward them, though he seemed to be
watching them narrowly. Just then there
came a sound at the basement door and a
shuffling of feet up the steps. In a moment
a sharp, wrinkled old face appeared above the
rail and a quavering, high-pitched voice demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, please? What is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon looked down at the bent old woman
who was peering up at him in a dim-eyed,
uncertain sort of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I desire to speak to&#8221;&mdash;he hesitated a
moment, then proceeded&mdash;&#8220;to the master or
mistress of the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I not told you a dozen times that
the house is empty? Are the police paid to
annoy people? I know nothing of those who
were here; I know nothing of the dead man
who was carried out in the night; I know
nothing except that the agent placed me in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
charge this afternoon, and that the rent is
fifty dollars a week, furnished. For anything
else you must not ask me; I am old, and
I must have my sleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that she went slowly and complainingly
down the steps, and they heard the
door close abruptly behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have gone,&#8221; said Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And apparently the attention of the police
has been called to some features of the case.&#8221;
Webster looked at his friend for a moment
and then added. &#8220;What are you going to do
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps to see Moritze &amp; Co.&#8217;s local
representative, in the morning, would do
some good. But, first, I think we may get a
little information from our friend across the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>They descended the steps and crossed the
street toward the policeman. The man regarded
them with attention, his thumbs in his
belt and his legs very wide apart.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; spoke Kenyon, in a
fraternal tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you?&#8221; answered the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this street part of your beat?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all of it, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the policeman seemed to have
made up his mind about them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>&#8220;Reporters?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something like that. I understand that
you had quite an exciting time of it hereabouts
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but say, how did the papers get it?
The captain said the matter was to be kept
quiet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the papers have many surprising
little ways of getting information. Now, the
body that was carried out of 98, for instance.
Nothing has been heard of it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and it has a nasty look. It&#8217;s the kind
of thing that we police don&#8217;t like. The detective
department has it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing is known of the people who occupied
the house, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing. They rented it furnished
for a term and paid the money down. They
gave the name of Farbush.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young men exchanged swift
glances; the policeman noticed the looks:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know anyone of that name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy I have heard it before,&#8221; replied
Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose you are not giving anything
away,&#8221; grumbled the man. &#8220;The afternoon
papers will be driving the police
out of business for good if they keep on the
way they are going.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be discouraged,&#8221; said Kenyon, with
a laugh. &#8220;You see, they don&#8217;t know so much
after all. They only appear to. For example
now, we don&#8217;t know where the man was
sent who was knocked out just about here
last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The policeman laughed, shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>man</i>?&#8221; repeated he.</p>

<p>Kenyon caught the inflection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, it wasn&#8217;t a woman, surely,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right about the papers not
being on to so much,&#8221; grinned the policeman.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ll have to call up Bellevue if you
want any information. As I said to start
with, this thing is supposed to be kept rather
quiet; and I think I&#8217;ve done too much talking
as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they walked down the street Webster
said thoughtfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;The complications seem to pile up, don&#8217;t
they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Amazingly. And with every lap the track
gets heavier. I think the best thing that we
can do is to pay a visit to Bellevue and have a
talk with someone there who can give us
definite information.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in the speaker&#8217;s tone
that made his friend look at him quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let the matter get on your nerves,
old boy,&#8221; warned Webster. &#8220;You&#8217;ll only put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
yourself in a daze; and then you&#8217;ll never get
to the bottom of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it; but then there is&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused abruptly and gestured the rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean the girl?&#8221; Webster frowned.
All along he had feared this phase of the
affair; the girl had struck him from the very
first as looming altogether too large in Kenyon&#8217;s
account of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for her,&#8221; said Kenyon, &#8220;the
entire matter would be a sort of joke to me.
But she changes the face of everything. I
can&#8217;t stop thinking of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you had better get into the habit of
trying,&#8221; growled Garry Webster. &#8220;You
know it doesn&#8217;t do to go about falling in love
with girls like this. Now don&#8217;t try to shut
me off! You <i>are</i> in love with her; if you
don&#8217;t know it, I do. I&#8217;m experienced. I&#8217;ve
been in love a half-dozen times myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused for a moment; and his tone
changed, as he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Ken, you don&#8217;t know anything
about her. As the thing stands it doesn&#8217;t
look even near right. It&#8217;s a police matter,
and she is unquestionably mixed up in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon winced at this and his face seemed
to lose a little of its color. But he said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that my remarks hurt some,&#8221; proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Garry. &#8220;But it&#8217;s a fact, and fact is a
thing that I&#8217;m strong on&mdash;it&#8217;s a thing that a
man doesn&#8217;t do well to brush carelessly by.
If he does he&#8217;s making a mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon put his hand on his friend&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t think me an ass, old fellow; I see all
these things you speak of&mdash;and perhaps
more, for I&#8217;m deeper in the maze than you
think. But in spite of it all, I can&#8217;t drive the
image of that unknown girl from my mind;
and I cannot help believing that no matter
what manner of things the others may be
guilty of, she is innocent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; returned Webster, with a sigh.
&#8220;Look at it as you see fit. I only hope you
prove to be right. There is a great deal in a
person&#8217;s characteristics, I know; and of
course I haven&#8217;t seen the girl. Perhaps, if I
had, I might feel just as confident of her as
you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you would,&#8221; said Kenyon, fervently.
&#8220;No one to look at her could feel
otherwise. I know that I&#8217;m talking like a
moonstruck sophomore, Garry, but just the
same I mean every word of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Webster sighted a cab and
signaled it. In a very short space of time
they had been set down at Bellevue Hospital,
and a nurse had summoned a white-clad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
pleasant-faced young surgeon. When he
heard their errand he looked interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said he. &#8220;The rather queer
matter of last night. Sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young men sat down and the
surgeon occupied the corner of a desk. Apparently
he made the same mistake as the
policeman had, for his opening words were:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the first reporters that have
called in reference to this thing; and there is,
I think, a most interesting story in it.&#8221; He
touched a bell, and a pretty girl in a nurse&#8217;s
uniform made her appearance. &#8220;Miss Dickson,
get me histories 906-7-8.&#8221; When the
girl had gone, the man of medicine resumed.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not often that we meet with such a
remarkable series of coincidences; but the
night has strange kinks in a big city, and the
accident ward of a hospital is the best place
to see them that I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl re-appeared, handed the speaker
three sheets of paper, and vanished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll read you these in regular order,&#8221;
promised the surgeon. &#8220;Then you&#8217;ll get
about the same effect that I did. And before
I begin I&#8217;d like to say that these are not the
regular histories demanded by the institution,
but private ones of my own. You see,&#8221; with
a smile, &#8220;these cases were so odd that I did
not mind going to a little extra trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>Selecting one of the sheets he began to
read:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thursday night, November 12th. About
9.30 the patrol of the 40th Precinct brought in
a case of assault. It was a man of about
thirty years of age and weighing about one
hundred and sixty pounds. He was of dark
complexion. He had been picked up by the
police upon the sidewalk in front of 98 Selden&#8217;s
Square. The injuries are three incised
wounds in the back, probably made by a knife,
and two contused wounds of the head. The
skull is most likely fractured.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since that was written we have discovered
that there is no fracture. The man recovered
consciousness and told how he came
in his present predicament. Afterwards,
during the absence of the nurse, he left the
hospital. Just why I don&#8217;t know, for he was
badly hurt and required attention and nursing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Turning to the second sheet he read as
follows:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thursday night, November 12th. At 10.18
the ambulance was called out. It brought a
second man, suffering the same injuries, and
who had been picked up in exactly the same
place as the first. This man, however, was
conscious and able to make a statement immediately.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>&#8220;Selden&#8217;s Square is a much more abrupt
place than I would have thought,&#8221; remarked
Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would seem. But listen to this
other.&#8221; The doctor read as follows from the
third sheet:</p>

<p>&#8220;Same night. About 12.05 I was called
down to receive a new case. It was brought
in by a cab-driver and a mail-carrier. The
latter, while on his last round of collection,
found the man lying in the middle of the
street in front of 98 Selden&#8217;s Square, and at
the next corner summoned the cab-driver to
his assistance. In this case, as in the other
two, the bludgeon and knife had played their
parts. This man was smeared with blood
and his clothing was torn into shreds. Apparently
he had given his assailants a desperate
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The physician laid down the last of the
sheets and looked at his visitors with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do you think of that?&#8221; asked
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remarkable!&#8221; answered Kenyon, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Astonishing!&#8221; said Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, too. But this is only the mildest
and most conventional side of the thing.
What I have yet to tell will make you despair
of finding adjectives to express yourselves.
But I can only give you the outline, as that is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
all that I have as yet. The first of these men
is from Butte, Montana. He is an engineer
in the employ of the Anaconda mine, and
apparently a thoroughgoing fellow, indeed.
The second is from the town of West Point,
and is a sort of private coach for backward
students at the Academy there. He is a
rather frail young man, with near-sighted
eyes and an impediment in his speech. The
third is from Saginaw, Michigan. He is a
small, compactly-built fellow, of about twenty-three,
and with the constitution of a young
bull. By profession he is a pugilist. His
first words when he recovered consciousness
were to inquire about the persons who assaulted
him. And when he learned that none
of them were in the ward, as badly used up as
himself, he was the most crestfallen person
I ever saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite a variety of types and temperaments,&#8221;
remarked Kenyon. &#8220;But what had
they to say for themselves?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I am altogether at liberty
to tell you that,&#8221; answered the young
surgeon, slowly; &#8220;It&#8217;s a sort of police matter,
you see. But if you&#8217;ll agree not to publish
until the authorities release us, I&#8217;ll give it to
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep it to ourselves,&#8221; promised
Kenyon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;Very well then. But as I said before, I
can only give you the outline of their statements,
at that. Each of these three men is an
absolute stranger to the others; yet each was
summoned to New York upon the same errand,
by the same man, and at the same time.
Upon the night of November 12th each arrived
in town, one from Butte, one from West
Point, and the other from South Bend, Ind.;
and each of them immediately made his way
to the place of appointment&mdash;98 Selden&#8217;s
Square. And as they arrived there, they
were attacked murderously and left for dead.
All this is strange; it only requires one more
touch to complete the mystery. And we have
that in the fact that the three men&#8217;s names
are alike.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is the name?&#8221; asked Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kenyon,&#8221; answered the young surgeon;
&#8220;and a rather unusual one it is, don&#8217;t you
think?&#8221;</p>

<small>THE NIGHT GROWS THICK WITH WONDER</small></h2>



<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dom Migual</span>: Hush! Walk softly. This night is filled
with astonishments.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>From an Unacted Melodrama.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the surgeon&#8217;s words Webster fairly
gasped his astonishment. But Kenyon&#8217;s face
was unreadable.</p>

<p>&#8220;A remarkable state of affairs, indeed,&#8221;
said the young adventurer. &#8220;And without a
doubt it has some equally surprising meaning
if we could learn all the facts. But you said
that you do not feel at liberty to tell us more,
did you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know a very great deal more,&#8221;
answered the surgeon.</p>

<p>&#8220;These men are not yet able to be seen, I
suppose&mdash;that is, the remaining two?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and will not be for some days to
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is too bad. I should have liked to
ask them a few questions.&#8221; Kenyon arose
and said: &#8220;Is it permissible for you to tell me
the name of the person who summoned them
to New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not. That is a point upon which the
police left special instructions.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>&#8220;Ah, pardon me! And thank you for what
you have already told us. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again they were upon the street, walking
along in silence, hands stuffed into overcoat
pockets and heads bent in deep thought.
After a space Kenyon said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Garry, my son, we don&#8217;t seem to
have come at anything of value, as yet, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather, we have gone deeper into the
tangle,&#8221; answered Webster. Then he laughed
in a sudden fit of boyish glee and continued:
&#8220;But, I say, it&#8217;s more fun than going a-fishing,
isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;d like to work at a thing like
this as a regular job. It&#8217;s got it all over
hardware for real interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that it&#8217;s going to be my
occupation, for a time, at least,&#8221; said Kenyon,
a certain grimness in his tone. &#8220;The
matter concerns me, and if it&#8217;s possible to get
to the bottom of it, I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; agreed Webster. &#8220;It&#8217;s your
place to do that very thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked back to Webster&#8217;s hotel, in
silence for the most part; when they arrived
Kenyon immediately took up a telephone directory
and began fluttering over its leaves.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just possible that the manager of
Moritze &amp; Co.&#8217;s New York branch may have
a &#8217;phone connection at his home and I may
catch him there,&#8221; explained he to Webster.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
&#8220;Oh, yes, here it is. His name is Leventhal.
I trust he is a snugly married man and is at
home just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few moments waiting he got the
number asked for.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to speak to Mr. Leventhal,&#8221; said
Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Mr. Leventhal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Manager for Moritze &amp; Co.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have just received a check upon your
house for a considerable sum, and I&#8217;d like
to make some inquiries about the person who
drew it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never transact business after business
hours,&#8221; said Leventhal, decidedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this is a matter of importance. I&#8217;d
like you to tell me what you can about Hong
Yo, who I think is known to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sharp exclamation at the other
end of the wire; after a short pause there
came the answer in the same cold tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never discuss our depositors with
strangers&mdash;or anyone else, for that matter.
If you have a check signed by Hong Yo it will
be honored instantly, no matter what the sum.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; cried Kenyon, hastily.
But it was too late; the other had already
rung off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>&#8220;I expected that,&#8221; remarked Webster.
&#8220;Bank people are rather close mouthed as
a rule. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll learn much from
that source.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon sat down and lit a cigarette. Under
the light bulbs his face had a drawn, harassed
look and the usually good-humored eyes had
a baffled, eager glow in them. But in spite of
this very evident mental unrest, the elegant
distinction of his manner was unimpaired;
and he brushed a speck of dust from his
sleeve with solicitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your two thousand dollars is going to
come in rather handy,&#8221; remarked he thoughtfully.
&#8220;It looks like a long hunt, and that
sort of thing takes money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is more where the two came from,&#8221;
said Webster. &#8220;Don&#8217;t hesitate to call again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221; Kenyon puffed at the cigarette
frowningly for a moment. &#8220;It means a
waste of both money and time,&#8221; grumbled he,
&#8220;and I suppose I&#8217;m next door to a fool for
bothering with it. But it&#8217;s got on my nerves
and I can&#8217;t drop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl again,&#8221; mused Webster, regarding
his friend with brooding glance. &#8220;He
doesn&#8217;t know it himself, half the time; but
it&#8217;s that confounded girl that&#8217;s doing it all.&#8221;</p>

<p>They discussed the different phases of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
case for some hours, and then Kenyon took
his departure. It was a long way to his little
hotel near the Battery, but he was in no
humor for riding, and turning into Broadway
he swung rapidly along down town. Lower
Broadway is almost deserted after business
hours, and when a man loomed up alongside
of him at Canal Street and fell into step,
Kenyon turned sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forrester!&#8221; he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, Kenyon, do you know you are a
great fellow to set the pace,&#8221; complained the
bulky youth. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to overtake
you ever since you crossed Fourteenth
Street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry,&#8221; replied Kenyon, recovering
his presence of mind instantly. &#8220;But
I did not expect to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other looked at him in frank astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what did you suppose had happened?&#8221;
asked he, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised at anything
happening,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But I had specified
nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other regarded him curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I suppose everyone has
his own way of doing things; but do you
know, you rather puzzle me sometimes?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>&#8220;I have no doubt of it,&#8221; Kenyon smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see it&#8217;s not just the way to which I&#8217;m
accustomed. I go at things in a more direct
fashion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule I do myself. But this matter is
different from most&mdash;so you must expect altered
methods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you are right. But you do so
keep me on the jump. And you don&#8217;t keep
me posted. You leave me to discover things
for myself. Now I had not the faintest notion
that you had succeeded in the big matter
until Farbush told me, about an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Things should work in their natural
course,&#8221; replied the adventurer, coolly; &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe much in p&aelig;ans of victory until
the thing is thoroughly clinched.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the curious look came into Forrester&#8217;s
eyes. Kenyon noticed it, and for a moment
feared that he had blundered. He had
come to the conclusion, finally, that to get at
the true inwardness of the matter in hand
he must float with the current, that he must
assume to be what they supposed him to be&mdash;and
so he did not desire to excite the other&#8217;s
suspicions. But the youth&#8217;s next words reassured
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is truth in what you say,&#8221; said
Forrester, slowly. &#8220;Somehow you keep
showing me that, right along; and,&#8221; with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
quick heave of his great shoulders, &#8220;I don&#8217;t
mind saying that I sometimes find it aggravating.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Personal feelings should never tinge matters
of business. That&#8217;s a useful rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I realize its value. But, then, human
nature is human nature. A man is bound to
grouch more or less when he finds himself
displaced. However, you&#8217;ve done more in
twenty-four hours than all the rest of us
combined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks. You are very good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must say that I don&#8217;t quite understand
it all; but the results are what counts and are
what I want to see. Farbush is quite carried
away by your success; but your, as he calls it,
boldness, has about taken his breath. He
would prefer less spectacular effects. You
see, these old money-squeezing fellows are
like moles; they get their victories by digging
underground; and to do things as openly as
you have done, frightens them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to steady his nerves. There is
no telling what sort of moves are on their
way, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t frighten me,&#8221; replied Forrester.
&#8220;As the matter stands it can&#8217;t progress
too rapidly to please me. I&#8217;m in a
hurry to get it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had stopped upon the corner of Canal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Street; it was late and a haze clung about the
roof tops. From the North River came the
constant shriek of fog-whistles and now and
then the boom of a bell; the numerous night
sounds from the river front came faintly to
them, for already the farm wagons were coming
in, and the great markets on the lower
west side were beginning to make ready for
the coming dawn.</p>

<p>Kenyon was silent. He cautiously determined
to follow the other&#8217;s lead. But Forrester
did not hesitate; he went steadily on.</p>

<p>&#8220;We waited for you at the &#8216;Far East,&#8217;&#8221;
continued he. &#8220;The Stalker reported that he
had given you Farbush&#8217;s instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Stalker?&#8221; Kenyon looked at the
other inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Didn&#8217;t he meet you as you
left Selden&#8217;s Square last night?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon&#8217;s mind went quickly back to the
night before, and immediately the stealthy
figure that had arisen out of the shadows recurred
to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I remember. But his words did
not impress themselves upon my memory, for
he sort of mumbled them over quickly and
vanished. He seemed to be rather in a
hurry.&#8221; Kenyon paused a moment and then
added: &#8220;Was there any urgent reason for
his haste, I wonder.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Forrester made a gesture that showed distaste.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps there was,&#8221; said he shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He formed, I think, a committee of one, to
receive the man from Butte.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not lacking in observation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is part of my stock in trade. And it&#8217;s
a faculty the possession of which depends
upon one&#8217;s constant exercise of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt. But when we found that you
did not keep the supposed appointment, Yo
suggested that I meet you at Union Square,
according to the general understanding, as
there might be reasons why you would not
want to be seen at the &#8216;East.&#8217; I had waited
more than an hour when you came along; and
when you did not stop, I thought you might
be followed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would there be any use in our going to
the Far East now?&#8221; asked Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; eagerly. &#8220;They are anxious
to see you, for there are many points that
they desire to make clear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I&#8217;m after,&#8221; replied
Kenyon. And for an instant he feared the
result of his words; for he had allowed, unconsciously,
a great deal of significance to
creep into them. But Forrester did not catch
this; apparently he was too much engaged
with his own purposes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s no great distance from here,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and we might as well walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits me,&#8221; returned Kenyon,
promptly.</p>

<p>And so they struck eastward along Canal
and turned down an ill-lit street which was
strange to the ex-lieutenant of Nunez. A
maze of alleys and narrow ways were traversed,
Forrester leading the way. And as
they hurried on, Kenyon gradually became
obsessed with the notion that a dark figure
was lurking in their track. Several times he
was upon the point of mentioning the matter
to Forrester; but each time he thought better
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be a little private arrangement
of his own,&#8221; reasoned Kenyon, silently.
&#8220;This would be a most excellent neighborhood
for an artistic piece of assassination,
and I shouldn&#8217;t wonder if that was his friend
the Stalker back there. But,&#8221; and he gave
a quick, puzzled look over his shoulder,
&#8220;somehow I can&#8217;t get quite rid of the impression
that it&#8217;s a woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>At any rate he quietly drew off his right-hand
glove; and there was much comfort in
the feel of the long, heavy Colt buried so
deeply in his overcoat pocket.</p>

<small>KENYON GOES BLINDLY ON</small></h2>


<p class="center">&#8220;Mott Street is as safe as Fifth Avenue&mdash;but you must keep
your eyes open.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Lieutenant in Chinatown.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Through</span> the dim, chasm-like streets Kenyon
followed Forrester; and always there
clung to him the feeling that there was lurking
along, in the thicker shadows behind
them, a soft-footed someone whose intentions
were as unknown as him- or her-self.</p>

<p>The section was strange to Kenyon. Overhead
the mist seemed to cling stickily to a
wilderness of fire-escapes, and by degrees the
air became impregnated with a peculiar odor.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s decidedly Asiatic,&#8221; commented Kenyon,
as he sniffed this. &#8220;Unless I am very
much mistaken we are approaching New
York&#8217;s Chinatown.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; answered Forrester.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in the midst of it in a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>True to his word they suddenly turned a
corner, and a little way ahead saw the glare
of incandescent lights, the strange, oriental-looking
shops and filthy doorways of the
Yellow Quarter. The slant-eyed Celestials
thronged the streets, some lank and wolf-like,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
others fat and placid, but all members of
murderous Tongs, and for the most part
carrying deadly weapons concealed in their
loose blouses. Here and there was a blue-coated
policeman; now and then a white
woman with painted cheeks and sunken eyes
could be seen staring through the dirty panes
of an upper window. Suddenly a great, illuminated
sign flared into view which bore the
name in letters formed of hideous green light:</p>



<p class="center">THE FAR EAST</p>


<p>&#8220;This, I suppose, is the place you spoke
of,&#8221; said Kenyon.</p>

<p>Forrester nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; he directed. They did not
enter by the wide, glaring door of the place,
in which stood some drunken marines, a
Chinaman or two, and a clump of women of
the street. Instead they used a small, dark,
side door, and after descending a narrow
passage found themselves in a room in which
a fat old Chinese woman sat crouched upon
a mat before what looked like an iron pot full
of red coals. Immediately upon their entrance
she began a muttering in her own sing-song
tongue, but never once lifted her eyes.
Before going to South America to join Nunez
in his expedition against Uruguay, Kenyon
had served the Chinese Government in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
brief war with Japan. So he was more or
less familiar with the language.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse-laden beast of a white devil!&#8221;
crooned the hag. &#8220;And have you come back,
once more? May there be no dawn in your
days, forever; and may the gates of sorrow
close you in!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A very gentle-dispositioned old lady,&#8221;
was Kenyon&#8217;s amused thought. &#8220;Apparently
Forrester is not very popular with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Forrester did not understand the old
woman&#8217;s words, nor did he pay the slightest
attention to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to ask you to remain here for a
few moments,&#8221; said he to Kenyon, in an
apologetic tone. &#8220;You see, it&#8217;s necessary
for me to locate the people we want; and
these places are regular rabbit warrens when
you get into them right.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room by another door. Kenyon
sat upon the edge of a table and listened to
the mutterings of the hag, for she had continued
in her reviling, still keeping her eyes
bent downward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fatherless worm!&#8221; she proclaimed.
&#8220;Your pale eyes are like the fish, and your
soul is as narrow as my thumb-nail.&#8221;</p>

<p>From somewhere in the distance came a fit
of coughing, weak, ominous, rattling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yo has the mind of an infant to trust to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
the white devils. The more he coughs the
more he trusts.&#8221; She held her fat, lumpy
hands over the coals and spat contemptuously
upon the floor. &#8220;He should keep his eyes
and his knife sharp. The ghosts of his holy
ancestors watch from the past and expect
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of the unassimilated,&#8221; thought Kenyon.</p>

<p>As the woman paid no heed to him he
approached a curtained space from beyond
which came the sound of many voices. Drawing
the curtain he saw a huge, low-ceilinged
room with walls painted with gaudy dragons,
scenes from the Chinese mythology, and glaring
with electric lights. It was crowded with
people, gathered about small tables, drinking
tea from tiny cups, and eating of the many
and curious Chinese dishes which the place
supplied. The hard-faced youth from the
lower east side was there, in plenty, with his
&#8220;girl&#8221;; a slumming party of scared-looking
women and embarrassed young men occupied
a far corner; meek, hollow-chested celestials
of the cooley class smoked cheap cigarettes
over their pots of tea, while those of the
dominant type, attired in loud American
dress, discussed their many trades and filthy
incomes in the unknowable slang of their
kind.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>&#8220;The regular thing, as far as I can see,&#8221;
thought Kenyon. &#8220;I suppose Mr. Hong Yo
is the head of the company and a thrifty man
of business. But I&#8217;ll do well not to be taken
in by appearances, however. These yellow
fellows have the ingenuity of the devil for
blinds of different sorts. While the &#8216;Far
East,&#8217; as they call it, may be a very pretty
business proposition, still it may serve to
cloak a less conventional trade than restaurant
keeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>He still stood with the curtain in his hand,
peering through into the main room of the
place, when the door from the street swung
open and a man and woman entered the
restaurant. At sight of the latter Kenyon
grew suddenly rigid and his breath hissed
through his teeth. Not that he could see her
face, for a heavy veil concealed that, nor her
form, for she was wrapped in a long, loose
cloak. But there was something about her,
in her way of holding herself, in her supple
walk, in the proud uplift of her head, that
brought back to him the girl of the hansom
cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s she,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;It is she. But
what under heaven is she doing here, and in
the company of a man like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her escort was indeed a most remarkable-looking
person. He was a well-built, determined-looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
man; but his face was death-like
in its pallor and his head was swathed in
bandages. As he walked toward a corner
table, he swayed weakly and the girl kept him
upon his feet. But the frequenters of the
&#8220;Far East&#8221; were accustomed to strange
night sights and the newcomers got scarcely
a glance save from the slumming party.</p>

<p>They had barely got seated when Kenyon
heard a step behind him, and, turning, found
Forrester just closing the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve been surveying the outer circle,&#8221;
smiled the giant, good-naturedly. &#8220;You
have nothing quite like it in South America,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly. But there are strange sights
there, also. The low coffee houses at Rio are
as picturesque; and even the Chinese have
little the advantage of the Latin when it
comes to vice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt you are right. But Hong Yo
and Farbush are awaiting you in Hong&#8217;s
place.&#8221; He looked inquiringly at Kenyon,
and after a pause of some length asked: &#8220;I
say, what is your candid opinion of Farbush?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I form an opinion of a person
of whom I know so very little,&#8221; he replied,
cautiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>&#8220;Well, you have heard how he has conducted
his share of the game. Surely you
must have arrived at some sort of a conclusion,
from that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon shook his head slowly; his assumption
of calm neutrality was perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will pardon me, I know,&#8221; he said,
suavely. &#8220;But I&#8217;d rather not express myself
upon so, to me, vague a point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would like to know, and Hong would like
to know, just how you stand, right there.&#8221;
There was a serious note in the young man&#8217;s
voice that at once caught Kenyon&#8217;s attention.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to give you the notion, though,
that we have split into factions, or are even
inclined to do so,&#8221; he added, hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should hope not,&#8221; added Kenyon,
gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we should like some sort of an expression
from you, just the same,&#8221; persisted
Forrester.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a later time I shall be only too glad to
express myself fully and completely.&#8221; There
was a finality in Kenyon&#8217;s tone that was unmistakable.
&#8220;Until that time comes, I prefer
not to go upon record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; replied Forrester, sulkily.
&#8220;Of course it is no great matter either
way. But I, for one, prefer to have a good
clear light upon my path and not to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
anything to the future.&#8221; Then he crossed to
the old hag, and bending over her began
whispering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not leave anything to the future!&#8221; was
Kenyon&#8217;s mental exclamation. &#8220;Great C&aelig;sar!
What would he do in my shoes, I wonder?
I am banking upon the future, entirely, for
my light; the present seems only to intensify
the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forrester continued his whispering to the
woman; so Kenyon once more drew aside the
curtain and looked into the large room where
sat the people of the night. His first rapid
glance was directed toward the corner where
he had last seen the girl and the man with the
bandaged head; but they were not there, and
his keen eyes ran over the room eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have gone!&#8221; he breathed. &#8220;And
where?&#8221; But he had little time to think
about it, for Forrester spoke to him, and he
had to give him his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Faing Sen, here, will lead you to those
whom you are to meet,&#8221; said Forrester, indicating
the hag. &#8220;Follow her, and don&#8217;t wonder
at the road or anything you might see.
As I remarked before, this is a regular rabbit
warren.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fat old woman arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;May seven times seven hundred evils
beset your path,&#8221; she wished, in her confidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that she was not understood. &#8220;And
may the gods look darkly upon your children&#8217;s
birth.&#8221;</p>

<p>That he understood what the old woman
said Kenyon kept to himself. But he remarked
to Forrester, with a laugh, &#8220;Faing Sen does not seem to be in a good
temper to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But then that is her normal condition.
She hates the white devil, I understand.
I know nothing of her lingo, and she pretends
to know scarcely any English. But I succeed
in getting along, somehow, when I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will the tall devil follow Faing Sen?&#8221;
inquired the old woman, beckoning Kenyon.
She had lighted a candle and stood awaiting
him in the doorway which Forrester had used.
&#8220;Has he no manners that he should keep her
waiting. Much fine-smelling wood shall she
burn to the four-handed joss to-morrow, that
the white devil&#8217;s eyes turn to water in his
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>She passed through the doorway and Kenyon
followed; as he turned, about to close the
door after him, he caught a glimpse of Forrester
as he stealthily drew aside the curtains
and looked into the public room. Then Kenyon
saw the curtains fall back in place, and
saw Forrester turn with an anxious look;
hurry through the other door, and disappear.</p>

<small>HONG YO STRIKES A BLOW</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;Let the knife be sharp. Then strike swiftly, and linger
not.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Creed of the Tongman.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Kenyon</span>, following Faing Sen, found himself
in a long passage similar to the one which
led from the street, only more dim and evil-smelling.
At the end of this, with much
groaning and panting and showering of evil
wishes upon the young man, the hag raised
a trap-door and bid him go down. But he
shook his head and motioned for her to go
first. Her little eyes gleamed wickedly in
the candle-light; but she went down into the
cellar obediently, Kenyon following close
behind.</p>

<p>The place was damp and foul; the yellow
flame flickered dimly upon the slimy walls and
threw grotesque dancing shadows before
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beautiful!&#8221; muttered Kenyon, as he
peered through the darkness. &#8220;A perfectly
lovely place to meet a man with a grudge
against one.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Faing Sen waddled stumpily along,
with never a look to the right or the left.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
Once the light was extinguished suddenly,
and the long Colt came out like a flash, while
Kenyon pressed with tight-shut lips against
the wall. But in a moment a match scratched
crackingly, and he saw Faing Sen calmly rekindling
the wick.</p>

<p>Then they moved forward once more. Kenyon
counted four times that they passed
through openings cut in the foundation walls;
then they came to a low, heavy door, upon
which the hag knocked.</p>

<p>After some whispering, this was opened
and they found themselves in a small, square
chamber with plastered walls, some mats
upon a cemented floor, and a large oil lamp
which hung from the ceiling. It was a
shriveled old man who had admitted them.
His face was small, bony, and wrinkled like an
ape&#8217;s; he wore a pair of huge, horn-rimmed
Chinese spectacles, and his toothless jaws
were in constant motion. He and the hag
consulted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who, O daughter of Faing Lo, is this
whom you have brought to the place of quietness?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A strange white devil whom Hong Yo
much wants to see. And he is sharp like the
wolf and does not trust women.&#8221;</p>

<p>She cackled with laughter and stole a quick
look at the young American. The old man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
bared his purple gums in a horrid grin and
nodded his shaven head many times.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes men are that way,&#8221; mumbled
he. &#8220;It is wisdom to be so. When a youth
I had seven wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>They chuckled and grinned like a couple of
gleeful ghouls; then the old woman took up
the candle and made her way back by the way
she had come. The old man turned to Kenyon
and motioned for him to be seated upon a
mat under the lamp. He bowed and smiled
in what was meant for an affable manner,
while he said in his native tongue:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dog of an unbeliever, thou who art too
mean to excite the anger of even the least of
the gods, sit there.&#8221; Then in English he
added: &#8220;Velly nice &#8216;Melican&#8217; young man!
Hong Yo will come in glate hully up. Me
Sing Wang; velly old and velly nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tottered out of the room through a
curtained doorway, leaving Kenyon looking
after him, a smile upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;You old rat,&#8221; muttered the American
amusedly. &#8220;Yes, you are very nice, indeed;
I&#8217;ll venture to say that that shrunken arm of
yours has in its day driven many a knife
home into some poor devil&#8217;s back.&#8221; He
looked curiously about, his keen eyes missing
nothing. &#8220;Hong Yo takes many precautions
when he receives visitors. I wonder why?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>He waited for some time, but Sing Wang
did not return. Then he became aware of
the murmur of voices engaged in altercation,
some deep toned and angry; others shrill and
wickedly pitched. Then in the midst of it
came a woman&#8217;s scream. His heart, for a
second or two, stopped beating; he recalled
the girl who had entered the &#8220;Far East,&#8221;
and the impressions that she had awakened
came back to him like a flash. Without an
instant&#8217;s hesitation he tore aside the curtains
and leaped with long, soft-footed, pantherish
bounds up a narrow stairway in the direction
of the sounds.</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs was a door which
stood partly open; thrusting this wide, Kenyon
found himself in a sort of square hall
from which opened many other doors. They
were all closed, but from over one a bright
light shone through an open transom. It
was from behind this door that the voices
came; Kenyon softly grasped the knob and
gave it a turn; but the door was fastened.
Pausing a moment, wondering what he had
better do, he heard a single high-pitched, but
wavering, voice, demanding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forrester! I want Forrester! He is
the man that brought me here first. I don&#8217;t
know the rest of you in this matter. He
wrote to me at Butte to come to New York;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
I had a good thing there, but he said that he
had a better one. And when he got me into
that damned hole, Selden&#8217;s Square, he done
me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By heaven, it&#8217;s the man from Butte!&#8221;
was Kenyon&#8217;s mental exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you want this person, Forrester, why
do you come here?&#8221; came the voice of Hong
Yo. There was no mistaking the hollow tone,
and the slow, precise English. &#8220;We have
told you that there is no such man here, and
that we know nothing of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take me for a fool,&#8221; spoke the voice
of the man from the mines, &#8220;I know what he
wrote me. I know the game and the players.
You say you don&#8217;t know Forrester, eh?
Well, let the girl speak; her eyes tell me that
she knows different.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a broken-backed chair in the
hall; Kenyon placed it at the door; when he
stood upon it his eyes were on a level with the
transom.</p>

<p>In a large chair directly opposite sat Hong
Yo. His emaciated figure was almost lost in
the folds of a flowing, flowered robe; his yellow
claws were clasped before him; more
than ever his fleshless face and shaven crown
made him look like a death&#8217;s-head; his rat-like
eyes still shone from their narrowed, puckered
slits. Near the Chinaman sat the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
whom Kenyon at once recognized as the one
Webster had described to him at the Waldorf.
Before them, leaning weakly against the edge
of a table, stood the one whom the ex-lieutenant
of Nunez had seen in the public room of
the Far East; despite his bandaged head and
the evident pain he was suffering, his front
was a bold one. But what riveted Kenyon&#8217;s
attention was the girl who was being held in a
chair at one side. Sing Wang and two hard-faced
coolies guarded her; and a handkerchief
was tied about her mouth.</p>

<p>And it was <i>the</i> girl! The girl of the hansom
cab! The young man&#8217;s heart leaped.
Then a fierce anger swept over him, and his
hand went swiftly to the long, smooth-barreled
revolver.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t dare to let her speak,&#8221; proceeded
the man from Butte, defiantly. &#8220;Because
you know you lie. You&#8217;ve double
crossed me for some reason, and I&#8217;m going
to get square. I&#8217;ll fix you all; you, you dying
devil,&#8221; pointing to Hong Yo, &#8220;and you, my
respectable Mr. Farbush; for all your pull
and high pretensions, I&#8217;m on to your game,
and I&#8217;ll open it wide for this whole town of
New York to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon saw Hong Yo rise. It cost him a
great effort, but he stood straight up. A fit
of coughing racked him; then he drew a handkerchief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
from his blouse and touched his lips,
while he took several steps toward the Westerner.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must not do this,&#8221; spoke he. He
returned the handkerchief to the bosom of his
blouse; and the hand lingered there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must not,&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy
to see that you don&#8217;t know me. I&#8217;m going to
get all your hides for this, and there is nothing
that you can say or do that will stop me.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the last words were spoken Kenyon saw
the yellow, skeleton-like hand flash out, and
caught the light as it played for a second
upon the side of a knife-blade. Then he
leaped down and threw himself like a catapult
against the door. As luck would have
it, it opened inward, and his weight and
power told at the very first plunge. The
door fell in with a splintering crash, just as a
wild scream broke from the lips of the girl.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_116.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">HE STOOD FOR A MOMENT IN THE DOORWAY</p>

<p>At moments like these Steele Kenyon was
like ice. Small things might shake or annoy
him, but sudden perils seemed to steady his
nerves and clarify his thoughts. With one
hand plunged into his pocket grasping the
Colt, he stood for a moment in the doorway.
Upon the floor before him lay the man with
the bandaged head; Hong Yo had fallen back
into his chair, his breath whistling in his
throat, the knife, now dripping with blood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
still held in his hand. Farbush was upon his
feet, while the girl had broken away from
those who held her and was gazing with
horror at the stricken man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you cowards,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;you
have murdered him. He was helpless and in
your power, and you have murdered him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes accusingly sought the face of
Hong Yo, then that of Farbush and lastly
Kenyon&#8217;s. And the burning scorn that was
in them was a thing to see.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not see you, at first, of course,&#8221; she
said to Kenyon, and there was a bitterness in
her tone that made him wince. &#8220;But I might
have known that you would be present when
such work was going forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave way a step or two, her eyes filled
with horror as he reached out one hand impulsively
toward her. He drew in a sharp
breath, like a man who is suddenly drenched
with cold water; but it steadied him and
brought the fact suddenly before him that he
was not there to set himself right in her eyes,
but to have an accounting with the others.</p>

<p>From the instant of his entrance the eyes
of Hong Yo and Farbush had never left his
face; the three other Chinaman stood stolidly
to one side, apparently awaiting orders. Now
Hong Yo spoke, breathlessly, but his frail
body seemed to sway with fury:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>&#8220;You did not wait then, Mr. Kenyon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you expect it?&#8221; asked the latter
coolly. &#8220;So much of interest was being
transacted here that I could not contain myself.
You cannot expect to monopolize all
the thrills in this affair while I am concerned
in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this there came a short, harsh laugh
from Farbush; the man had reseated himself
and was gazing at Kenyon with evident admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think Mr. Kenyon is right,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;As he is partly in for any consequences that
might have to be borne, it is only just that he
should have a voice in directing things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Kenyon, evenly. &#8220;And let
me remark that I don&#8217;t altogether approve of
such work as I see. It is coarse.&#8221; He
looked down at the body with distaste, and
then lifted his eyes to the men, once more.
&#8220;Not that Hong Yo does not do a neat and
effectual job,&#8221; continued he, in his even tone.
&#8220;His present performance speaks for itself
and plainly shows past experience. But I dislike
this smeary sort of business. It is not,&#8221;
and his white, well-kept hand gestured fastidiously,
&#8220;a desirable method at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight movement behind him
in the hall; the impulse was still forming in
his mind to wheel and face what might be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
grave danger, when a voice&mdash;the voice of
Forrester&mdash;whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand as you are! Don&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Kenyon felt the girl brush by him
through the doorway. Farbush sprang up,
as he caught the movement, shouting:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop her!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo came weakly to his feet, his fleshless
hands clawing the air; Farbush and the
coolies leaped forward, but Kenyon&#8217;s stalwart
form blocked their way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the young adventurer,
quietly, &#8220;that it is best that she should go. I
have something to say to you, gentlemen, that
it would be as well to go over in private.&#8221;</p>

<p>They halted, glaring at him, as he stood
leaning nonchalantly against the door-frame.
His top-coat had fallen open, showing his
immaculate evening dress, his level eyes were
fixed steadfastly upon them; his right hand
secretly caressed the grip of the long revolver.
And from somewhere in the building
came the sound of racing feet which constantly
grew fainter and fainter.</p>

<small>THE SECOND NIGHT ENDS</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;Keep cool, and always hold your guard high.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>Kenyon&#8217;s &#8220;Art of the Sabre.&#8221;</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last the receding footsteps of the girl
and Forrester died away altogether; Kenyon,
in spite of his icy exterior, had been filled
with a nameless dread, but now experienced a
quick sense of relief. Hong Yo and Farbush
stood looking at him, mingled wonder and
rage in their faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; spoke Kenyon, in a business-like
tone, &#8220;if you will get rid of the worthy Sing
Wang and his friends, I will come to the
matter in hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment.&#8221; It was Hong Yo that
spoke and his slit-like eyes seemed even more
narrow than ever. &#8220;There is but one way of
explaining this,&#8221; indicating the gaping doorway
in a way that showed that he referred to
the part Kenyon had just played in the girl&#8217;s
departure. &#8220;Only one way!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon smiled enigmatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;And is that one way not sufficient?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>For a moment Hong Yo stood looking at
him in silence, and Kenyon noticed that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
grim mouth of Farbush grew straighter and
harder. Then the Chinaman motioned to
Sing Wang and the two coolies, and pointed
silently toward the body. Then he led Kenyon
and Farbush into another room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down,&#8221; said Hong Yo, huskily.</p>

<p>All three seated themselves at a table.
Kenyon was careful to select a chair facing
the door, for he had not forgotten the creepy
feeling that Forrester had given him when
that personage had crept up behind him a few
moments before. Then Hong Yo seemed to
recollect something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I had forgotten
that you two had not met before. Mr. Kenyon&mdash;Mr.
Farbush.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two nodded an acknowledgment, examining
each other closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you found it necessary to tell
him,&#8221; then said Hong Yo, incredulously.</p>

<p>Kenyon nodded. He had not the faintest
notion what was meant, but followed the plan
of indirection in his answers which had so
far served him so well. When he broke into
the room a short time before he had had but
two objects in his mind, to rescue the girl
and force a &#8220;show down&#8221; from the murderers
at the point of his revolver.</p>

<p>But, somehow, he now felt that the girl was,
for the time being, safe under the care of Forrester;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and the temptation to let the adventure
take its own course was once again
irresistible. There was a peculiar fascination
in his position; these men, for some reason,
regarded him as being of vast importance in
a mysterious and far-reaching game. That
they would halt at nothing was amply
proven; but Kenyon had always felt a certain
zest for danger; and then there was the girl,
whose brilliant face had so attracted him.
She was concerned in some strange way; she
stood in peril, perhaps, of her life.</p>

<p>So he resolved once more to stick, no matter
where the current took him, and until the
end of it all was reached.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not think it possible that he even
knew of her existence,&#8221; remarked Farbush,
after a long silence, during which he and
Hong Yo had been exchanging looks.</p>

<p>&#8220;This must be the mysterious &#8216;he&#8217; of whom
the old man spoke last night in Selden&#8217;s
Square,&#8221; thought Kenyon. &#8220;It&#8217;s delicate
ground, and I must be careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He rested his chin in the palm of one hand
and his elbow upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows a great deal more than you&#8217;d
think,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Handle him carefully,&#8221; implored Farbush.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him suspect you. Above
all, don&#8217;t tell him more than you must.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>&#8220;There is no great danger of that,&#8221; smiled
Kenyon. &#8220;You forget that I don&#8217;t know
any too much, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a sudden grin upon the gaunt
face of Hong Yo; his wasted fingers pattered
upon the table&#8217;s edge as though in applause.
He bent toward Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;If there is one thing that I like more than
another about you,&#8221; he said in his slow, distinct
English, &#8220;it is that continual guard
which you hold up. In my experience I have
found that the man who consistently denies
having special knowledge never betrays himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon was suddenly called upon to struggle
against an almost irresistible desire to
laugh; it was a difficult task, but he succeeded
in retaining his gravity. The thing was really
absurd!</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he said anything about what his
plans are, now that the old man is dead?&#8221;
inquired Farbush, eagerly.</p>

<p>Kenyon never quite understood what
prompted him to do it, but under a sudden
impulse, he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not know that the old man is
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had a thunderbolt split the roof and
dashed everything in the room into splinters
it could not have had a more startling effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
upon the two men who sat facing him. Instantly
they were upon their feet, their hands
wildly gesticulating, their lips babbling in
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; almost shouted Farbush, beating
the table, &#8220;I never dreamed of such luck.
It&#8217;s like a miracle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their sudden outbreak had dismayed Kenyon;
for a moment he feared that he had
somehow betrayed himself. But at the words
of Farbush, he drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Luck&#8217;s with me!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But in
the future I&#8217;ll refrain from taking chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have thought that your very appearance
would have told him all,&#8221; spoke
Hong Yo.</p>

<p>&#8220;But as it happens it didn&#8217;t. He is a practical
sort of a person, and takes very little for
granted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the old man thought him a
dreamer!&#8221; cried Farbush, opening his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did the old man really know him very
well?&#8221; asked Kenyon, meaningly.</p>

<p>Farbush seemed struck by this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, no, perhaps not. But outside all
else, yours is a splendid piece of news. It
gives us so much more time; and time was
the one thing which we sadly lacked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you and he talk about?&#8221; asked
Hong Yo.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>&#8220;About many things, but nothing of much
importance. I was satisfied to hold him
safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he ask questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the beginning he did little else. But
I told him nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>A hollow chuckle came from the Chinaman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can well believe that,&#8221; he said, grimly.</p>

<p>Kenyon was silent for a space, and the two
watched him with interest; there could be no
question but that, whatever their enterprise,
it was expected of Kenyon to make the move
that would bring things to a crisis. So far
he had been kept dodging their questions;
Forrester had told him that they had tidings
of importance for him, and he was anxious to
hear what it was. So he asked, carelessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing in the meantime?&#8221;
looking from one to the other. &#8220;Anything
that might interest me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl, as you see, suspects something,&#8221;
said Hong Yo. &#8220;There is no telling
how deeply she was in the old man&#8217;s confidence.
He loved her as he loved no one else;
and trusted her in many things, as we now
find.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; put in Farbush, &#8220;has always been
an uncertain point to me. If he trusted her
so, how much did he tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon found the eyes of both fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
steadily upon him; and the expectancy in
their gaze gave him his cue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m supposed to have inside information
right here,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;But then the
sphinx-like attitude, I think, is the safest:
and it seems to tickle Hong Yo. So I had
better maintain it.&#8221;</p>

<p>So he smiled enigmatically and shook his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;She knows less than you think,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>There was a deep frown upon Farbush&#8217;s
face, and he rapped out sharply:</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps of the things you mean&mdash;yes.
But what of the others?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon gestured indifferently; he drew a
case from his pocket and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I understand that you are blaming me
for this state of affairs?&#8221; he asked, evenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is right,&#8221; said Hong Yo, quickly interrupting
Farbush, as he was about to reply to
this. &#8220;Mr. Kenyon has had nothing to do
with the side of the matter to which you refer.
That is, and has been, entirely in our own
hands from the beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon was delighted to hear this; but he
concealed any facial manifestation of it by
throwing up a dense cloud of smoke between
them. But Farbush seemed impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not trying to fix responsibility, but
merely making a statement of facts,&#8221; declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
he. &#8220;We are all together in this, and
each, I hope, is eager for success. So it is
well, if anything slips, to make it known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I quite approve of that,&#8221; said Kenyon,
with candor. &#8220;But just what is it that the
girl has discovered, or been told?&#8221;</p>

<p>Farbush nodded toward the room which
they had left a short time before.</p>

<p>&#8220;She came here with him, for one thing;
and she knows that my private safe contains
matter of consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot imagine how she ever became
acquainted with that man.&#8221; He hesitated
and then darted a quick look at Hong Yo; a
new idea seeming to have entered his mind.
&#8220;Can it be possible that Forrester has told
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not a fool,&#8221; replied the Chinaman.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are times when I am not altogether
sure of that,&#8221; returned he. &#8220;Witness his
work,&#8221; with a gesture. &#8220;It is not the sort of
thing to be proud of.&#8221;</p>

<p>That there was a decided feeling between
Farbush and Forrester seemed certain.
From what the latter had said in the rear
room of the &#8220;Far East,&#8221; Kenyon had begun
to suspect this state of affairs; now he felt
sure of it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s a situation that may prove exceedingly
useful in the future;&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;And I think I&#8217;ll do well to make a note of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I warned you not to trust too much to him
in the first place,&#8221; said Hong Yo. He coughed
weakly, and applied his handkerchief to his
lips. &#8220;He is young and without experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The first of these I will grant you. But
the last I must question. Was it not his
manipulations that brought matters to a state
where we could take hold? Is not that experience?
Did it not apparently show
talent?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a trace of anger in the man&#8217;s
voice. But as the direction of the talk did
not please Kenyon, he interposed, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that I have not a great deal
of time. We were speaking of the girl, and
of some information that she had gained.
I&#8217;d like to be fully informed upon this point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. After all, that is the real kernel
at the moment. You see, she came to me this
morning and without any preamble asked me
to turn over everything having to do with the
case to her for examination.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! And did she state why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She volunteered nothing, save that it was
her duty and her right to have a complete
understanding of the affair. It is possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
that she only suspected that I was possessed
of what she desired to know, and assumed her
air of positiveness to deceive me. When I
refused she said that she would see Hong
Yo&mdash;and, if she must&mdash;yourself!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon went on smoking quietly; if there
was any surprise in this statement for him
he did not show it.</p>

<p>&#8220;She must be most anxious to obtain facts
if she would go the length of asking Kenyon
for them.&#8221; And Hong Yo laughed, his teeth
showing hideously, as he did so.</p>

<p>Farbush echoed the laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said he. &#8220;She would be most
anxious, indeed. For somehow, Kenyon, she
doesn&#8217;t seem to have taken a fancy to you&mdash;that
is, not the sort of fancy a girl should
take to the man whom her friends have
selected as her husband.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not news to me,&#8221; replied Kenyon,
without a trace of feeling in his voice or manner.
&#8220;She dislikes me, in fact, and is at no
pains to conceal it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo bent forward across the table, his
narrow eyes fixed upon the young adventurer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought last night that you seemed
struck by her appearance,&#8221; spoke he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps so.&#8221; Kenyon&#8217;s voice was cold
and repellent; the Chinaman noticed it and
drew slightly back.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;I merely wished to warn you, that is all.
This is a matter of business. It will not do
to introduce any entanglements or impediments.
We have had enough of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;But there is
no need to warn me, as you call it. My eyes
are clear enough to see what I must avoid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Farbush smiled grimly and nodded his
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we may safely trust you for that,&#8221;
remarked he.</p>

<p>Kenyon looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything else?&#8221; he asked, in a
bored sort of way. &#8220;I really have very little
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; and Farbush laughed a little,
&#8220;except that the girl threatened to proceed on
her own account and in her own way, if she
were not dealt with considerately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon fancied that he detected a shade of
anxiety in the man&#8217;s laughing words; but he
said nothing, allowing him to proceed.</p>

<p>&#8220;And her coming here to-night shows that
she might have some notion of keeping her
word. She came to see Hong Yo, as she said
she would&mdash;and with her came an astounding
companion. I had laughed at her up to that
point; but now,&#8221; with a shrug, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know
what to think.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;It has a queer look,&#8221; admitted Kenyon.
&#8220;But perhaps it is not as serious as it seems.
At the worst, she can know but little of consequence.
And that little she cannot use.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let her attempt it,&#8221; cried Hong Yo, with
that deadly creeping gesture of the hand
toward his breast, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; interrupted Kenyon, &#8220;that you
left that plaything of yours inside there. So
there is no use in your feeling for it.&#8221; He
arose to his feet, and slowly began drawing
on his gloves. His face was cold and hard,
and the look in his eyes was unmistakable.
&#8220;And I think it as well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;to
warn you against anything of that sort. My
short acquaintance with you, Hong Yo, has
shown me that you have the temper of a half-dozen
devils; and, also, that you are not given
to controlling it. But this girl must not be
harmed! Do you understand? No matter
what she does or says, she must not be
harmed. She can injure us but little, if she
does her worst. But, as I have told you, <i>he</i>
knows about her, and from that you must
draw your line of policy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; answered Hong Yo, sullenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. And now if you will have the
worthy Sing Wang or someone else show me
the way, I&#8217;ll be going.&#8221;</p>

<small>AND THE THIRD NIGHT BEGINS</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;Men go quietly upon the missions which they think will
bring them much.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>A Maxim of Hong Yo.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day Kenyon had his belongings,
which he had now generously added to, removed
to a hotel some distance up town.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has not the flare of the Waldorf,&#8221; he
told himself, as he sat down to dinner, &#8220;and
it&#8217;s not nearly so expensive. But it will do.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was still pondering over the menu when
who should enter the caf&eacute; but Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I say, but this is luck,&#8221; exclaimed that
young person, dumping himself into a chair
at the opposite side of the table. &#8220;I got your
notice of removal about an hour ago, while I
was deep in the selecting of a menu for a tight
old wax that I hoped to land for a good order.
But right on top of your message came a
&#8217;phone call from him saying that he couldn&#8217;t
keep the dinner appointment after all. So I
dressed and hurried over here for a bite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have happened better,&#8221; said
Kenyon. &#8220;Because I want to discuss a few
things with you, rather badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave the man, who stood at his side,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
a carefully selected and rather elaborate list
of dishes; then he turned to his friend once
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; said he, slowly, &#8220;I was a
witness to what Captain Marryat once fascinatingly
called &#8216;a most desperate and
bloody murder.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Heavens!&#8221; ejaculated Webster, staring
at him. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a Chinese den on the lower East Side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After you left me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster leaned back in his chair and
wagged his head from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;What you need,&#8221; stated he, impressively,
&#8220;is to have someone legally appointed to look
after you. The first thing you know, you&#8217;ll
be given an acting part in one of these little
dramas that you appear to have grown so
fond of; and then we&#8217;ll have to gather you up
carefully with a rake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon nodded, humorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I&#8217;d been thinking
along that line. It&#8217;s one of the logical
resultants, I suppose; but then we all must
take our chances, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there another story?&#8221; asked Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly. Rather, a continuation of
the same one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better. If there are no restrictions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
such as the surgeon labored under last
night, I&#8217;d like to hear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a low voice and in as few words as possible
Kenyon related his experiences of the
preceding night, while Garry listened in silence.
When he had finished, the young man
from Chicago murmured, helplessly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this is a wonderful world, to be
sure! And there are astonishing things happening
in it. It would have been a great deal
better for the unknown from Butte if he had
remained comfortably in his cot at Bellevue
and allowed them to doctor at him. Do you
know,&#8221; after a pause, &#8220;I should like to get a
peep at your friend Hong Yo. He must be
an exceedingly interesting person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is,&#8221; replied Kenyon. &#8220;But he is
nothing like as interesting as some of the
others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The girl, for example.&#8221; Webster pursed
up his lips disapprovingly. &#8220;Well,&#8221; reluctantly,
&#8220;I must admit that later information
seems to indicate that she is not sitting in this
game as a partner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s more likely to be a victim of some
sort. And they are afraid of her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A nasty state of affairs. For people like
those to be in fear of anyone is for that person
to make a quick exit. But the supposed
knowledge of the great unknown as to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
existence seems to be a most effectual barrier
in this case. I wonder why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221; By this time the dinner was
well under way and both young men were
doing justice to it. &#8220;But,&#8221; continued Kenyon,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t for the life of me make out
Forrester&#8217;s position. He talked of me supplanting
him. He seems to have been, at one
time, in almost complete control of the game
they are engaged in. And yet, as I told you,
he is one of the most frankly honest men in
appearance that I have ever set eyes on. I
can&#8217;t help classing him with the others; but
still&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His coming to the rescue of the girl, so
to speak,&#8221; said Webster, &#8220;is a point in his
favor. And her going with him so readily
is another. I think it is also to his credit that
this man Farbush does not approve of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Hong Yo does; what do you make of
that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m stumped. The whole thing is as puzzling
as it was at the first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one small matter that has a
peculiar fascination for me,&#8221; stated Kenyon,
as he trifled with his dessert. &#8220;And that is
the private safe of Farbush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so!&#8221; exclaimed Webster. &#8220;That
little point slipped me. But what do you
suppose is in it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea. But Farbush
seemed startled at the girl&#8217;s having any
knowledge of it. I&#8217;m inclined to think that if
we had the contents of that safe on this table
between us for a half hour we would have
little guessing to do afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By Jove, Ken,&#8221; laughed Webster, &#8220;do
you know I&#8217;d almost expect you to venture a
burglary if you knew exactly where to head
the enterprise. You&#8217;ve got it in your eye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon looked at his friend with a sudden
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But,
now that you mention it, I&#8217;ll give it consideration.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you take on the job,&#8221; said Webster,
tickled with the conceit, &#8220;let me know,
will you, I&#8217;d like to go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster had a theatre party on for the
night, and as the time drew near for his departure
he urged Kenyon to go along. But
the latter refused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some thinking to do,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and I&#8217;m going to take a half-dozen cigars
out with me for a walk. So trot along, old
fellow; I&#8217;ll see you to-morrow night, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Madison Square is not much frequented
during the chilly nights of late November, so
Kenyon, muffled up in his overcoat, tramped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
up and down, drawing hard at a strong cigar
and thinking deeply. At the end of the cigar
he suddenly paused as though his mind had
been made up to something.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps they&#8217;ll know at the hotel,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;It will do no harm to inquire,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode along up Fifth Avenue and
turned into the Waldorf-Astoria. One of the
hotel&#8217;s private policemen saluted him in the
lobby, and Kenyon called him aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for information,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;There is a man I know slightly who comes
here, I think, at times. His name is Farbush.&#8221;
Here Kenyon described the man.
&#8220;Can you tell me where he lives?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farbush? I don&#8217;t know the name, but
there is a man that comes here occasionally,
and who answers to that description. Is
your man a ship-owner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say. As I mentioned, my acquaintance
with him is slight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see the head-waiter. If he&#8217;s a regular
customer, he&#8217;ll know something about
him, sure. Waiters always do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was gone but a very few minutes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said he upon his return. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s the same party. He is interested in shipping.
Head-waiter knows him well. Lives
on Fifth Avenue, up near the park. Initials<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
are J. F. Don&#8217;t know his number, but you&#8217;ll
find it in the directory.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon acted upon this suggestion and secured
the desired address. Then he caught
an uptown bus, and in a little while was
standing before the house named, but upon
the opposite side of the avenue.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Farbush appears to be a person of
some consequence,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;And that
only makes him a more dangerous man to contend
with. But before I take any steps I&#8217;ll
have to be sure that this is the same man. It
would hardly do to disturb a disinterested
party,&#8221; dryly.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, a cab drew up at that
moment before the house, and a man and
woman alighted. The woman Kenyon could
not make out; but the man he recognized at
once as he turned in the glare of the cab lamp
to pay the driver. It was Farbush. Kenyon
watched both up the steps and saw the door
close behind them. Then he hailed the same
cab.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Bowery and Houston Street,&#8221; directed he,
as he slammed the door. Down
Fifth Avenue rolled the cab, over the smooth
asphalt, then into Broadway and finally
Houston Street. When they pulled up at the
Bowery, Kenyon got out. Handing the cabby
his fare, he said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>&#8220;You look like an old New York boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Born and raised in the Sixth Ward,&#8221; answered
the man, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Maybe you can tell me what I
want to know. There used to be a place
somewhere on the Bowery near here kept by
a man named Brady&mdash;Gypsy Brady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the cops put Brady out of business
long ago. You see, New York grew out of
those places where they had bad whiskey and
bad music. Either one of them must be good
now,&#8221; with a grin. &#8220;But if you want the
Gypsy, he&#8217;s easy found. Lives over Schmelzer&#8217;s
place in Pell Street. It&#8217;s a pool-room.
Anybody will tell you where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little later found Kenyon making his way
among the human drift that thickens such
slack water as Pell Street. The stench of
the low Chinese dens was almost unbearable;
now and then he met the large-pupiled gaze
of a gray-faced wretch begging money with
which to purchase his dearly loved drug. But
Kenyon paid little attention to anything save
his hunt for Schmelzer&#8217;s place. At the corner
of a foul-looking alley he encountered a
short, large-bodied youth in a striped sweater
and a cap.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for a pool-room kept by a
man named Schmelzer,&#8221; said Kenyon. &#8220;Can
you tell me where to find it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>The short youth looked him over carefully
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll spot you three, and take you on at a
dollar a game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon shook his head and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not playing to-night,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;m
looking for a friend of mine who I&#8217;ve been
told lives over Schmelzer&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other looked disappointed; but he
pointed down the street, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;See the big blue blaze at the second story.
That&#8217;s the hut. There is a Chink bean foundry
on the first floor, and Schmelzer is on the
next. On top of that you&#8217;ll find the hay-piles.
Break in by the side door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Kenyon.</p>

<p>The place indicated was but a short distance
away. Passing the entrance to a
strong-smelling Chinese restaurant, Kenyon
found a narrow, dirty-looking doorway. He
passed up a flight of stairs, and at the first
landing came upon Schmelzer&#8217;s in full blast.
Men in pronounced clothes and with hats
slanted at different angles played expert cues
at the tables; about the ends of the room
groups were formed discussing subjects of
professional interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pickpockets, second-story operators and
pikers,&#8221; commented Kenyon, as he went on
up the next flight. &#8220;It looks like a cosey corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
of Chicago when that good old town was
a howling wilderness.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the next landing he found himself confronted
by a small, dirty-faced girl, with
tangled yellow hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you want?&#8221; demanded she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Brady,&#8221; answered Kenyon. &#8220;Does
he live here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want with him?&#8221; inquired
the child.</p>

<p>The adventurer looked down into the sharp
little face, so smutted and old looking.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an old friend of mine, kidsy,&#8221; answered
he. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a dime.&#8221;</p>

<p>A grimy little hand shot out for the coin.
Then she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;He lives back there, in the last room.
Knock hard on the door. Maybe he&#8217;s
drunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon picked his way along the dirty hall,
and rapped at the door at the end.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; growled a rough voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, Brady?&#8221; responded Kenyon.
&#8220;Can I come in?&#8221;</p>

<small>KENYON MEETS AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;The deeds of one&#8217;s youth are long remembered.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Strategy of Nunez.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> voice growled something in an undertone
that Kenyon could not understand. But
he promptly took it as an invitation to enter,
and so pushed open the door. A thick-shouldered
man with a dark, bloated face was
stretched upon a broken-springed sofa; and
as Kenyon entered he lifted himself to a sitting
position.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who the hell are you?&#8221; he growled.</p>

<p>Kenyon smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;There was a time, Gypsy, when you
prided yourself upon your memory. It must
have gone back on you of late years, if you
don&#8217;t recognize old friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old friends!&#8221; The man glowered at the
speaker. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any old friends.
No man that is down and out has. When me
coin run out, it was the side street and the
far-away look for mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon drew a stool toward him and sat
down, first throwing his top-coat and crush-hat
aside. The man regarded his immaculateness
with frowning wonder.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>&#8220;How long has it been, Brady,&#8221; inquired
the caller, &#8220;since you saw my old acquaintance
the &#8216;Steamhammer&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>Brady stared for a moment, then a grin
gradually stole over his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you now. You
are that young guy from West Point.&#8221; He
arose and shook hands with Kenyon. &#8220;I&#8217;m
glad to see you. You were once the handy
boy, all right,&#8221; admiringly. &#8220;You had a
shot in either hand that would have made you
champion of America if you had been in that
line.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just wait a minute,&#8221; continued the
Gypsy, with a wink. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a friend here
that&#8217;s sort of backward-like, when people
call.&#8221; He went to a closet at one side, pulled
back the catch and threw open the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Slim,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You can come
out. It&#8217;s a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall, angular, huge-boned fellow stepped
silently out of the closet. He had a hawk-like
face and a pair of small, shifty green
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to know the gent,&#8221; said he. He
sat coolly down upon a trunk and began to
roll a cigarette. His fingers were supple and
discolored. &#8220;You see,&#8221; by way of explanation,
&#8220;when a guy is in demand, why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
it&#8217;s him for the deep, dense shade. Do you
get me? There is no sense in lingering
around in places where you might get sunburned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand,&#8221; said Kenyon.</p>

<p>The Gypsy waved the subject away, as being
without special interest. He seemed in a
reminiscent mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;The night that you came into the &#8216;Paradise
Garden&#8217; is one that will always stick to
me,&#8221; said he, with a chuckle. &#8220;Ah, that was
a time when I could rope up the yellowbacks
in bundles thick enough to keep back the cops.
But New York&#8217;s changed since then. It&#8217;s
full of Chinks, Yiddishers, Guinnies, and people
with money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard of that old place of yours,
often,&#8221; spoke the shady one, lighting his
cigarette. &#8220;But I never saw it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; said the Gypsy to Kenyon.
&#8220;Big Slim here is from St. Louis. He only
struck New York a few years back. They&#8217;d
never mugged him here, and he was looking
for a new field.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It should have been &#8217;Frisco or old K. C.
for me,&#8221; complained Big Slim. &#8220;The guns
have gone all over this island and there&#8217;s not
a thing on it, except in Wall Street, that&#8217;s not
chained short.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you&#8217;d drifted in in the old days<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
you&#8217;d have found it different. A guy could
accumulate a pull then, if he had the change,&#8221;
stated Brady. &#8220;And he could go as far as he
liked.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, then resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the &#8216;Paradise Garden&#8217; was a mint;
money came in by the ton, and I only had to
stop this side of murder. And it was the
place to go,&#8221; with great pride. &#8220;Anybody
that blew into New York had to take a flyer
at my place to be in the running. It cost
them something; but it was worth the money.
The show I gave them was the real goods;
and the drinks were fine&mdash;if the buyer was
sober. What&#8217;s the use of wasting good liquor
on a guy that&#8217;s stewed to the eyes. He can&#8217;t
appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your reasoning is highly modern,&#8221; said
Kenyon, dryly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You managed mit-pushers then, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked Big Slim, rolling a second cigarette.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. Local champs, you know, with followings
of friends. The friends were always
good shots over a bar. They could hit the
cash register with a silver dollar every time
they&#8217;d try. It was a pleasing performance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Gypsy had lost his scowl, and his eyes
glistened at the thought of his more prosperous
days.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>&#8220;But,&#8221; he resumed, &#8220;of all the chamois
artists I ever managed, the &#8216;Steamhammer&#8217;
was the biggest winner. You see, he worked
in Washington Market, and all the marketmen
and longshore people would be on hand
whenever he&#8217;d engage. And they were
a thirsty lot. I&#8217;d have to sit on the safe
all night with a gun after they&#8217;d been on
the job.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had the Hammer for almost a year.
Twice a week I&#8217;d advertise him as open to
meet all comers at the middleweight limit;
and he&#8217;d gone right along the line putting
them away without missing once. At last the
bugs began to whisper to me that I had the
wonder of the age; and that it was my correct
move to put him in front of the big mixer himself.
But our friend here,&#8221; indicating Kenyon,
&#8220;saved me the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; inquired Big Slim, interestedly.
&#8220;Tell us how.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He came into the Gardens one night with
a lot of them West Point fellows. I think it
had been a football day, and they were wild to
pull something off. They had heard about
the Hammer, and when I made the regular
offer from the stage about him being willing
to exchange wallops, one of them was on in a
minute and the rest of them were howling
with joy.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s that sort of thing that boys do,&#8221;
apologized Kenyon. &#8220;And I was very young
then, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were fifteen pounds lighter than the
Hammer, I know that,&#8221; grinned Gypsy
Brady. &#8220;And when you put up your guard I
thought he had you sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he didn&#8217;t?&#8221; interrogated Big Slim.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t even come near doing it. You
see the Hammer&#8217;s regular stunt was to rush
his man up to the wall&mdash;I only had ropes on
three sides&mdash;pin him against it with his left
hand and pour it into him with his right.
When he thought he&#8217;d handed over enough
he&#8217;d pull out the pin, and the guy would generally
drop. But this time the game didn&#8217;t
work. The boy from the army school met
the rush with a body stab that brought the
Hammer up short; then he feinted him into
a tangle and shot one over on his baggage
truck that put him away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Slim nodded admiringly; he liked a
neatly executed job.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not nearly so difficult a proposition
as you might think,&#8221; said Kenyon. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not in good training for that sort of thing
just now; but,&#8221; and he looked at the Gypsy
attentively, &#8220;I&#8217;d rather tackle another job
like it, than the one I have in mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought there was something that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
brought you here,&#8221; returned the ex-divekeeper.
There was an eager look upon his
dark, swollen face, at the prospect of profit of
some sort. &#8220;Is it anything that you&#8217;d like to
see me in private about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not,&#8221; answered Kenyon. He
turned and regarded Big Slim keenly. &#8220;I
rather fancy that our friend here will be of
assistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only open for engagements of an indoor
nature at the present time,&#8221; volunteered
the man from St. Louis, seriously. &#8220;But if
there is anything that I can do for a friend
of the Gypsy&#8217;s, why, I&#8217;ll be glad to take it
on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want a complete burglar&#8217;s outfit,&#8221; said
Kenyon to Brady. &#8220;And I also want a full
line of instructions as to how to break into a
house, and how to force a safe when I get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Big Slim cracked the joints of his huge
fingers and only appeared mildly surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to take up house-breaking,
are you?&#8221; inquired the astonished Gypsy,
when he had recovered his speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as a regular thing,&#8221; answered Kenyon,
easily. &#8220;But it happens that there is a
house in town that I want to see the inside of,
and don&#8217;t care to wait for an invitation. Now
if you can put me in the way of getting what I
want, I&#8217;ll pay you your own price.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>&#8220;As you have guessed,&#8221; said the Gypsy,
&#8220;Slim is a cracksman; and if he has a mind
he can fix you up.&#8221; He turned to the other,
inquiringly, &#8220;What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it,&#8221; answered Big Slim promptly.
&#8220;But the stuff comes high,&#8221; to Kenyon.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got the finest kit in New York; it took
me years to get it together. Every tool will
do its work, and is strictly up to date.&#8221; He
looked at the adventurer with calculating eye.
&#8220;You could carry enough in your pockets to
let you into anything but a money-fort. And
I&#8217;ll hand it on to you, together with a full
day&#8217;s instructions in the use of the stuff, at
five hundred dollars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrap them up,&#8221; replied Kenyon, quietly.
&#8220;And if it&#8217;s all the same to you, I&#8217;ll have the
lessons begin right now.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE UNINVITED GUEST</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;&#8217;Twas in the garden of Beaucaire;</div>
<div class="verse">I met her on a secret stair.</div>
<div class="verse">The night was centuries ago.&#8221;</div>
</div></div>
<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>Old Ballad</i></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> thick, sticky mist that sometimes blows
uptown from the bay veiled Fifth Avenue;
and a thin rain fell steadily. The lamps
shot their pale rays mysteriously through the
fog; cabs and busses rolled drippingly by;
and soggy pedestrians hurried along under
streaming umbrellas.</p>

<p>The theatre crowds were on their way
home, after their hour in the White Light
restaurants; but in a little while their time
had passed, and the avenue was silent and
deserted save for a policeman who would now
and then appear, and almost as quickly
vanish.</p>

<p>Most of the houses were gloom-fronted; a
few scattering windows in the section just
below the park showed night lights; but one
house was brilliantly illuminated, and a long
line of carriages was drawn up at the curb.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when Kenyon came
along, enveloped in a rain-coat and with an
umbrella held over his head.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>&#8220;By George!&#8221; muttered he, &#8220;it is really at
Farbush&#8217;s! What luck! To get inside now
should be comparatively easy. What a fortunate
thing it is that he should be giving this
thing, whatever it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood in the drip of a roof across the
street and watched the gaily lighted house.
At length a party came out, protected by
umbrellas held by footmen; these latter immediately
returned and several other parties
came out at once and scurried for their
vehicles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now is my chance,&#8221; said Kenyon. He
swiftly crossed the street, passed behind a
carriage into which several exclaiming
women were being helped, then up the wide
steps and into the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I return your things to the coat-room,
sir?&#8221; asked a servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks&mdash;yes,&#8221; answered the adventurer,
quietly.</p>

<p>He handed his coat, hat, and umbrella to
the man, who received the latter surprisedly.
Its folds streamed with water, and he was
clearly wondering if the rain were not heavier
than he had thought it. However, he took
the things away without any comment, and
Kenyon, with a light breath of relief, walked
into a room in which he could see a number
of men smoking.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>His entrance being quiet and matter of
fact, of course attracted no attention whatsoever.
This was what he had calculated upon;
he wore the conventional evening clothes; at
a glance he looked exactly like the other males
present, and no one could say that he was an
intruder.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is, no one but Farbush,&#8221; mused Kenyon,
as he took a cigarette from a box upon a
stand. &#8220;And if he should happen upon me,
no doubt I can find a few things to say to him
that would sufficiently account for my presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was lounging calmly in a big chair when
a voice at his side remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fair cigarette that Farbush keeps,
isn&#8217;t it. If his champagne were as good I
should have nothing to complain of.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon turned. A pale-eyed young man
with a budding mustache had drawn a chair
up close to him, and was in the act of lighting
a cigarette. There was a friendly, inconsequential
look upon his chubby face, and the
adventurer&#8217;s eyes snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, they are rather a good sort,&#8221; replied
Kenyon, inspecting his cigarette critically.
&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t tried the champagne.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other made a wry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you may consider yourself lucky,&#8221;
said he. &#8220;These old fellows like Farbush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
should really leave their cellars for someone
else to select. They do make a most dreadful
mess of it sometimes. Now, Farbush possibly
knows all about tea, and about ships
and Chinese stuff and all that, but he&#8217;s a baby
on the vintage subject. I had about fifteen
dozen of that &#8217;93 some time ago which I tried
to induce him to buy; but he actually scoffed
at it. And then he springs a thing like this
to-night upon his unsuspecting friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you sell wines?&#8221; said Kenyon, with
a show of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the usual sense,&#8221; returned the
young man, hastily. &#8220;No, no! I sometimes
have a small quantity of a few select brands
to dispose of to my friends&mdash;more to give
them the benefit of my experience than anything
else. That is all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon smiled. He had heard of the wine
agent in society and had known the cigarette
boomer at college.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our most philanthropic purposes are not
always appreciated,&#8221; said he. The other
shook his head in a way expressive of a wide
and early acquaintance with that particular
fact. &#8220;Now Farbush is a friend of mine,&#8221;
proceeded Kenyon, &#8220;but I must admit that
he&#8217;s rather shaky upon a good many things.
Did he build this house, do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he did.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>&#8220;That is what I thought. It&#8217;s about the
sort of thing he <i>would</i> have put up,&#8221; criticised
Kenyon, with a severe expression, which
said as plainly as words that architectural
sins would only be properly dealt with if
placed among the deadly kind. &#8220;It&#8217;s all out
of reason, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say, really,&#8221; returned the pale-eyed
young man, hesitatingly. &#8220;Architecture
is a bit out of my line, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon had been more or less confident of
that; nevertheless he was pleased to hear the
confession, and launched forth in a very
caustic condemnation of Farbush&#8217;s mansion.</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the way the rooms are laid out
that I particularly criticise,&#8221; declared he.
&#8220;The whole thing is a jumble. Now, I have
no doubt but that a man so inoculated with the
poison of commercial life as Farbush would
have his home office in the most conspicuous
room in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but he hasn&#8217;t, I assure you,&#8221; the other
hastened to say. &#8220;His apartment for the
transaction of his own private affairs is just
at the head of the first flight of stairs&mdash;a large
room, but quite out of the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should have thought differently,&#8221;
replied Kenyon, grudgingly.</p>

<p>After a little more talk, largely upon the
part of the wine agent, that person arose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>&#8220;I see most of them are going,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I suppose the rain must have let up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Kenyon noticed that Farbush had
entered the room, and stood by the door leading
to the hall, shaking hands with his departing
guests.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be preferable were he not to see
me,&#8221; he thought. So now that his new acquaintance
had left him, he arose, and quietly
passed through a curtained doorway. The
room was almost deserted; however, in one
near at hand he could hear the laughing chatter
of a great number of women.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got but a very few minutes, perhaps,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;So I&#8217;d better get to
work.&#8221; He looked out into the hall, from
still another doorway. The street doors were
wide open and the footmen were calling the
carriages in the impatient tone of men who
were wet and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think the excellent Mr. Farbush
would have done well to have spread a canopy
from his door,&#8221; thought Kenyon. His keen
eyes took in the fact that no one was observing
him; and in an instant he had gained the
stairway and had begun to ascend. It was a
solid, hard-wood staircase, very wide, with
massive balustrades and newel posts. And
there were many turns in it, and many landings.
Kenyon had reached one of these and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
stood in the glare of a cluster of lights to
look back. As he was so posed he heard the
rustle of silken skirts above him; he turned
swiftly. Around a bend in the stairway,
leaning over the heavy rail and gazing down
at him was a girl&mdash;a tall girl, with a great
crown of blonde hair and delicately tinted
face. It was Anna!</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenyon!&#8221; she whispered; and he saw
the sudden fear in her blue eyes.</p>

<p>For a moment the adventurer was at loss.
But as was usual with him the feeling was
perfectly masked; to all appearances he was
cool and entirely at his ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, how do you do?&#8221; smiled he. &#8220;I&#8217;m
charmed, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him fixedly; it was evident
that she was struggling against her surprise;
but her voice shook as she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&mdash;what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Social affairs always have an attraction
for me,&#8221; replied Kenyon. &#8220;I like to meet
people and exchange ideas with them. The
general effect is freshening, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl had recovered somewhat from her
first astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;How foolish of me to be surprised,&#8221; she
smiled; &#8220;of course you were among those
asked. I recall it distinctly now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon regarded her with fresh interest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
There was the same appealing air about her
that he had noticed in Selden&#8217;s Square; a
girlish sweetness and helplessness that drew
one powerfully. But he had noticed another
thing. The sweetness and innocence, if anything,
increased when she spoke of her recollection
of his being asked there that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might be a hallucination of hers, of
course,&#8221; thought Kenyon, as his keen eyes
searched the girl&#8217;s face. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not sure
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit on the stairs with me?&#8221; asked
Anna. Her teeth were of dazzling whiteness,
and her manner full of sudden witchery. &#8220;I
know it&#8217;s very silly and school-girlish, but
I&#8217;ve always liked it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fascinating place,&#8221; said Kenyon, as he
sat at her feet. &#8220;Unnoticed we can speed the
parting guests through the rails. It&#8217;s one of
the discoveries of college days that are really
worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed a little at this. The light in
her eyes danced softly and girlishly. But for
all her smiles Kenyon thought he saw a tightening
at the corners of her mouth. It was as
though she were possessed of a nervous dread
of some sort.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy,&#8221; thought the ex-lieutenant of
Nunez, &#8220;that I have been inopportune in some
way.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>&#8220;You are not going to-night, then?&#8221; said
Anna, eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; replied Kenyon. &#8220;In a very
little while.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was an expression of relief in the
girl&#8217;s eyes for an instant, and then she
pouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancied that uncle would have you with
us while you are in town.&#8221; She hesitated
and then laid her hand upon his shoulder.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m sure that Dallas would be
pleased.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dallas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. You must not be guided altogether
by appearances. Neither should you
heed what others might say. She is an odd
girl in some ways. And proud!&#8221; with a
pretty gesture of dismay. &#8220;I never saw such
pride before.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was <i>the</i> girl that she referred to! Kenyon
drew a long breath and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with you as to the pride. Her
attitude toward me, so far, has been rather&mdash;ah&mdash;distant
to say the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she has not treated you well to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she here?&#8221; exclaimed Kenyon, caught
by surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. Mr. Farbush always insists
upon our being present at affairs like this.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
He is a widower, you know, and he depends
entirely upon us to entertain his guests. But
is it possible that you have not spoken with
her?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a curious glance. He saw
that it would not do to make admissions of
any sort; they were inclined to be dangerous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only ventured out of the smoking room
upon one or two occasions,&#8221; remarked he.
&#8220;And then the rooms were so crowded.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; that is true.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he could see that she was far from
being satisfied, for she immediately came back
to the subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a very ardent lover, it would
seem,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;I should think that a
man would be breathless in his search for his
lady-love, anywhere in which he had occasion
to think she would be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is just possible,&#8221; answered Kenyon,
slowly, &#8220;that I did not dream of finding her
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly, and he felt her
small hand tighten upon his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are thinking of the affair of a few
nights ago at Hong Yo&#8217;s,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Oh,
how dreadful, how horrible it must have been.
And before her very eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have heard about it, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Griscom informed me. And then Dallas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
also told me, afterwards. But she was compelled
to return here. No matter what has
been done we cannot leave here, now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; answered Kenyon, in a
thoughtful way. &#8220;There is much more than
personal feeling to be considered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what we both think. Otherwise
we would not have remained an instant after
the night in&mdash;in Selden&#8217;s Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time the last carriage had departed,
and they heard the front door slam. Then
the harsh voice of Farbush was heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, come in here, Shallcross; I&#8217;ll
go over that matter with you in detail.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard footsteps in the hall below; and
a door opened and shut.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, now!&#8221; exclaimed Anna. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
not have a chance to say good-bye to him as
you go. That is Mr. Shallcross, the ship-builder
from Seattle. They will be deep in
tonnages and such stupid things for the next
hour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; said Kenyon, as he arose.
&#8220;You can say good-night for me&mdash;in the
morning. I&#8217;ll get my coat and other things&#8221;&mdash;as
though about to pass her on the stairway.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the coat-room is below,&#8221; she informed
him, hastily. And it also seemed to
him that she instinctively barred his way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>&#8220;Oh, how stupid of me,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I
fancied it was on this floor. That is why I
was coming up in the first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; she said, holding out her
hand, with an eagerness that was a trifle
feverish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>There was no one below that he could see.
The empty coat-room was only dimly lighted.
He entered and drew on his long rain-coat
and took up his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose there is no hope for it,&#8221; he
muttered, half angrily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go
after all. I had hoped that I wouldn&#8217;t be
compelled to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A murmur of voices outside the partly-opened
coat-room door caught his ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billings, get that rug in off the steps.
Mr. Farbush will raise the devil if he hears
about it being wet. Old Potter threw it out
there because he thought that fat wife of his
would slip.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later the street door opened and
then shut heavily. A man passed on his way
to the rear of the house. Kenyon opened the
coat-room door wide. All the lights, save
one, in the lower hall were turned out; and
that one only dimly illuminated the place.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve gone, if she&#8217;s listening,&#8221;
muttered he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>With his hand upon the stair rail once more
in the act of ascending, Kenyon caught a
familiar sound. It was the rich rustle of
silken draperies; and through the shadows
he made out a figure in white, bending forward
upon the last stretch of the staircase.
He crouched close to the wall, and held his
breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has gone,&#8221; he heard the voice of Anna
murmur. &#8220;Oh, how I fear that man!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, softly, she stole up the staircase once
more, and Kenyon was left alone. He cautiously
made his way into one of the great
rooms at the front of the house. It was dark,
save for what light entered at the windows,
from the street. Settling himself in as comfortable
a chair as he could find he lay back
and began to go over the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;So Anna is afraid of me,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;Well, that is not altogether a pleasant thing
to hear. If I were younger I would be inclined
to doubt my personal fascinations.
And, while I think she meant it in a general
way, I&#8217;m pretty sure that there is some reason
to think that she had a special fear of me
to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>He crossed one leg over the other and
placed his clasped hands behind his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could have a cigarette, just now,&#8221; his
thoughts went on, leaping from one thing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
another, &#8220;I think it would help me. But I
suppose it is too risky. Somehow that girl
gave me an odd impression. I can&#8217;t get rid
of the notion that there is another enterprise
beside my own afoot here to-night. Take her
fright at sight of me. Her relief when she
found that I had not been asked to stay over
night. Her anxiety that I should go. Her
placing herself before me when I made as
though to pass her. Her stealing down the
staircase to make sure that I had taken my
departure.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another enterprise would mean what?&#8221;
He smiled at this. &#8220;Heavens, how is it possible
to form any sort of a judgment in this
business. It gets more snarled every minute.
I never did know just what my position was
in it; and now I&#8217;m beginning to get tangled
as to the relative positions and attitudes of
the others concerned. But, pshaw! What&#8217;s
the use. No amount of reasoning will do any
good, when one hasn&#8217;t anything to use as a
base.&#8221;</p>

<p>Patiently he waited. An hour went by;
then he heard the sound of chairs being drawn
back. The ship-builder, Shallcross, took his
departure, saying good-night to Farbush, who
let him out. Then Farbush closed the door
and came back through the hall. From the
position which he had now taken behind a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
porti&egrave;re, Kenyon saw the man stop under the
single light for a moment, his head bent as
though in deep thought. Then with a gesture
and a muttered oath he turned off the light;
and the intruder listened to his slow, careful
steps down the hall and up the stairway.
Then there was silence.</p>

<p>Once more Kenyon resumed the easy chair,
leaning back with closed eyes, patiently waiting.
Almost an hour went by. Then he
arose to his feet and stretched himself,
luxuriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me,&#8221; he mused, &#8220;as though I
had been in this line of business for some
time. Perhaps in a former state I was a
famous cracksman. What an alarming idea!
However, if it be true, I only hope that some
of my one-time skill still lingers. I&#8217;ll have
use for it to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>From his pocket he took a square of black
silk with two round holes cut into it. This
he snapped about his head with a rubber
band, and pulled it down over his face. Then
he buttoned his overcoat up to his chin.</p>

<p>&#8220;The front of a dress shirt has a certain
amount of sheen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I&#8217;d better
provide for meeting anyone in the halls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon his feet he drew a pair of soft felt
creepers; then he stole noiselessly to the door
and listened. All was still. Apparently the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
servants at the back of the house had also
gone to bed. From his vest pocket he drew a
tiny electric torch and, pressing the button,
it shot its narrow shaft of light along the hall.
Almost instantly, however, he shut it off, and
began to ascend the stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the head of the first flight of stairs,
said my friend the wine agent,&#8221; thought Kenyon.
&#8220;But I wonder upon which side.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the head of the stairs all was black; he
paused and listened once more. Then the
tiny beam of light flashed here and there. At
the left was a door partly ajar. The light
died, and he took a noiseless step forward.
He could not see the door, now, but trusted
to his judgment of distance to place his hand
upon the knob. But his hand was yet reaching
out, when the hinges of the door began to
creak slowly in the silence. He grew as rigid
as a statue, for every instinct told him that
he was standing face to face with someone in
the darkness.</p>

<small>KENYON IN A NEW R&Ocirc;LE</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;Take plenty of time. Keep cool. Don&#8217;t make a sound.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Advice of Big Slim.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Kenyon literally held his
breath. There was no movement, though his
ears were strained to catch any sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoever it is,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;they are
standing, listening, the same as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>With the greatest possible caution he drew
back a step; the soft felt creepers prevented
any noise and he exercised the greatest care
that there should be no rustling of his clothing.
He had retreated three or four steps
when he touched the opposite wall; and as he
stood listening he caught the creaking of the
door once more, as though the unknown had
opened it wider. Then there came a faint
fall of footsteps, gentle and guarded; and
through the thick darkness came the trembling
whisper:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon made no sound. There was a silence;
then he heard a deep, long-drawn sigh&mdash;the
sigh of one who has been waiting and
listening. Then the whisper came once more&mdash;a
woman&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I saw a light&mdash;just for an
instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then something passed Kenyon. It was
within a foot of him as it went by; but he
could not detect even its lineaments, so impenetrable
was the darkness. The footsteps
were slow, cautious, and soft. His skin
prickled for a moment as the nervous dread
of the unknown was communicated to himself.
Then the sounds died away at the other
end of the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Anna!&#8221; Kenyon told himself this
positively. &#8220;And when I suspected a rival
enterprise I was correct.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slipped quietly within the room from
which the unseen woman had just emerged.
The curtains had been tightly drawn and the
apartment was as inky as the hall. He feared
to flash the torch, thinking that it might throw
a reflection through the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might not be the office after all,&#8221;
thought Kenyon. &#8220;If it is not I&#8217;ll have gotten
myself into a devil of a mess.&#8221;</p>

<p>In taking the next step his hand touched a
hard, polished surface; moving farther it
came upon a clutter of papers, an ink-stand,
pen-rack and other clerical requisites.</p>

<p>&#8220;A desk,&#8221; muttered the adventurer. &#8220;And
a good sized, flat-top desk, at that. This is
the apartment I&#8217;m after.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Suddenly from the doorway came a sharp,
crackling sound. Instantly Kenyon sank
down behind the desk. Someone had scratched
a match, but it had missed fire. At the second
attempt it flared redly, however; Kenyon
could not see who held it, for he feared to
raise his head above the level of the desk.
Then the nature of the flame changed and it
grew steadier; footsteps sounded upon the
thickly carpeted floor. They were gentle
footsteps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna once more!&#8221; thought Kenyon.</p>

<p>He changed his position soundlessly, his
ears telling upon what side of the desk the
girl was about to pass. His situation was a
most fortunate one. He was between the
desk and the wall farthest from the door.
The entire room was before him. Cautiously
he lifted his head, as he felt sure, judging
from the direction in which she was going,
that she would not see him.</p>

<p>Over the flat top of the desk he caught sight
of the cloaked figure of a girl. Her back was
turned toward him, and a hood was drawn
over her head. And she was bending over
the combination lock of a gleaming safe of
formidable appearance.</p>

<p>She had lighted a candle and this she now
stood upon the top while she knelt before the
safe. Round and round she turned the knob,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
pausing now and then to think. But each
effort was without result; and finally she
leaned her head forward upon her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crying,&#8221; thought Kenyon. &#8220;Well, my
dear Anna, that will not do any good. And
if you have no better trick to play than trying
to guess the combination, you might just as
well go back to your little white bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment the girl remained in this
position; then she arose and moved toward
the door. As she reached it, she blew the
candle out, and once more blackness hung
over the office.</p>

<p>Kenyon remained as he was for some time.
When he felt assured that the girl had gone
for good, he arose, crossed the room and
softly closed the door. Again the tiny torch
flashed. Then he found the switch and turned
on the lights. The key was fortunately in the
door and this he turned, leaving it in the lock
to fill up the hole.</p>

<p>The whole appearance of Kenyon had
changed; his movements were quick and pantherish,
and not one of them was wasted; his
eyes gleamed through the holes of his mask,
as he swept the apartment. Then he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How lucky! Farbush has been thoughtful
enough to put in running water. Oh,
after all, there is nothing like modern plumbing.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>From his pocket he produced a small generator
of shining brass; this he placed upon a
table. Then he drew out several sections of
a tube of the same metal, which he joined
snugly together. From a breast pocket he
took a rubber bag partly filled with calcium
carbide, which he poured into the generator.</p>

<p>This having been done, he threw off his
overcoat and approached the safe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Newest pattern, as far as my information
goes,&#8221; he said calmly. &#8220;But it&#8217;s all the same
to the acetylene flame.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried the knob in order to make sure
that the safe was locked. He had once heard
of the absurd oversight of a cracksman who
had spent hours drilling into a safe that was
open, and had no desire to repeat the performance.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this one is tight enough,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>He took a rug from the floor, folded it
neatly, and placed it before the safe door.
Then he carried the generator to a small
washstand at one side of the office, and ran a
quantity of water into it. Almost instantly
the choking flames of the acetylene gas assailed
his nostrils.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he ejaculated, turning his head
away; &#8220;if there is a more awful stench in
the world than this, I&#8217;ve never encountered
it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>Quickly he ignited the evil-smelling gas,
and screwed the blowpipe to the generator.
Then he knelt upon the rug, placed the pipe to
his lips and blew through it steadily. A darting,
intense flame leaped forth, like a finger
of light; this Kenyon directed toward a point
just above the combination knob. The varnish
disappeared like magic, and the steel of the
safe melted like solder before the fierce point
of flame.</p>

<p>&#8220;It works well,&#8221; said Kenyon, pausing in
his blowing to inspect critically the small hole
burned through the massive door. &#8220;At this
rate I won&#8217;t be long on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more he placed his lips to the blowpipe,
and once more the needle of light bored
its way into the steel. Larger and larger
grew the hole in the safe; and at last Kenyon
found it wide enough to insert his hand and
arm. Placing the generator upon the floor
he reached in and began manipulating the
tumblers of the lock. Then he threw the door
wide, and sat back upon his heels with an
exclamation of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;The inner door is easy enough,&#8221; he said,
as he extinguished the generator. &#8220;Big
Slim&#8217;s master-key should have no trouble in
opening it&mdash;but what&#8217;s this?&#8221; He bent forward.
&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the key itself, ready to my
hand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>He inserted the big key, turned it, and the
inner door opened. Before him were a great
number of pigeon-holes and small drawers,
all filled with documents of various hues and
sizes.</p>

<p>The adventurer gazed at these, appalled.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m looking for!&#8221;
he thought. &#8220;This really promises to be a
worse job than opening the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, he resolutely set to work examining
the contents. By good fortune, all the
packets were labelled plainly, so that he was
not forced to open any.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a saving of time and my feelings,&#8221;
thought the cracksman. &#8220;I have no desire to
investigate Mr. Farbush&#8217;s affairs any farther
than they concern me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paper after paper, packet after packet,
passed through his hands, but still no sign of
anything that had the slightest interest to
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet, how can I be sure of that?&#8221; he
asked himself. &#8220;I never felt so helpless and
incompetent to deal with a situation in my
life. This,&#8221; and he turned a heavy envelope
over in his hands, &#8220;might be exactly the thing
I&#8217;m searching for; but how am I to know one
way or the other?&#8221;</p>

<p>The envelope was large, made of stout
manila paper and sealed with two huge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
splotches of black wax. Across the face of it
was written in a large, running hand:</p>



<p class="center">ESTATE OF STEPHEN AUSTIN.</p>


<p>&#8220;This might be it,&#8221; thought Kenyon; and
he shrugged his shoulders and laughed.
&#8220;And when I come to think of it, somehow,
it seems to me that this name is familiar to
me. It is just as though&mdash;by George, yes!
It is just as though I had heard it on the
night of my adventure in Selden&#8217;s Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at the envelope, swift eagerness
in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll chance it,&#8221; he muttered. He was
about to tear it open when suddenly a small
white hand darted over his shoulder and
snatched it from his grasp. He turned with
a startled exclamation and caught a glimpse
of a dark, cloaked figure; but at the same
instant the lights were switched off. As he
sprang up, he heard the door thrown open,
and heedless of the darkness he darted
toward it. Soft feet were running on the
stairs.</p>

<p>Kenyon paused and leaned against the
door frame.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; said he, &#8220;and in another moment
she&#8217;ll probably have the house in an uproar.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words had no sooner left his lips than
there came a muffled scream from the hall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
below. Kenyon leaped to the stair rail and
bent over, listening. Then the lights below
were switched on, flooding the stairway and
hall; to Kenyon&#8217;s amazement he saw Griscom
Forrester and Anna standing pale-faced and
startled at the foot of the stairs; while confronting
them with blazing eyes and a revolver
in his hand was Farbush.</p>

<small>KENYON CALLS ON THE MAN FROM SAGINAW</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>Doggerels of Balmacenso.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Garry Webster</span> sat in his rooms, a high-ball
before him, and a fat black cigar burning
between his fingers, when Kenyon was announced
early next evening. Webster demonstratively
shook him by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down and drink something,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;I&#8217;m about as glad to see you as I&#8217;ve ever
been to seen anyone in my life. Why, it&#8217;s at
least two nights since I dined with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon waved away the Scotch, but lit a
cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why all the pleasure?&#8221; he inquired,
calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, in view of your proceedings of late
I think I was warranted in feeling slightly
concerned about you. A fellow of your quality
and disposition takes a fair chance of having
someone run a knife into him. If I were
you, Ken, I&#8217;d avoid dark and unfrequented
spots, and I&#8217;d suspect people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be an attractive arrangement
for a maiden lady,&#8221; said Kenyon, dryly, &#8220;but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
I don&#8217;t think it quite fills the bill of requirements
of a man engaged in a more or less
desperate game.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster looked at him observantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still going on, then?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>Kenyon nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, just what phases have you lately
passed through. I&#8217;m willing to admit that I
am all of a-tremble; but at the same time I&#8217;m
strong on curiosity. Your use of the word
desperate seems advised; so if you have anything
to tell, tell it quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; spoke Kenyon, knocking the
ash from his cigar, and inspecting a loose
spot in the wrapper, &#8220;I made an attempt to
get at the bottom of this case at one blow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not quite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look here, Ken,&#8221; said Garry, and he
looked aggrieved. &#8220;This is not the proper
treatment for a friend. I would even be
disposed to regard it as unnecessarily harsh
to an enemy. It&#8217;s not charitable, and it&#8217;s not
kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t rush me,&#8221; protested he. &#8220;The
whole matter has my ideas in such a tangle
that it will not require much more to have me
completely off my nanny. Since seeing you
last, I have had manifold adventures, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
have added to my experience in life to an unexpected
degree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go at it like a popular lecturer,&#8221;
remarked Webster, patiently. He lit another
cigar and sipped at the high-ball. &#8220;If I don&#8217;t
do something to calm myself, I&#8217;ll be coming
over there and doing you a mischief, as they
say in the Drury Lane melodramas.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the third time within a week, Kenyon
related his experiences to his attentive friend.
He began with their talk at dinner some
nights before and the idea that he had conceived
from Webster&#8217;s laughing remark.
Then he went on to his hunt for Gypsy Brady,
his meeting with the cracksman, Big Slim,
then until he reached the scene in the lower
hall of Farbush&#8217;s mansion. Webster brought
his fist down upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;That settles it!&#8221; exclaimed he. &#8220;This is
the end of it. Never again will I permit you
out of my sight. You are without mental
poise or a shadow of forethought. And as
for common sense, I don&#8217;t believe you ever
had a shred of it in your life. Don&#8217;t sit there
and laugh! I mean it. The other stuff that
you have been meddling with was bad enough,
Heaven knows; but this last business is the
absolute limit. Think of it! Breaking and
entering; masked burglary; safe cracking!
Why, it&#8217;s unbelievable.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take another drink,&#8221; advised
Kenyon, quietly. &#8220;Your nerves seem
to be in a shocking bad way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster glared at him for a moment, and
then burst into a perfect gale of laughter.
His round face was scarlet and his eyes were
filled with tears when he brought chokingly
up and began to splutter and cough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it,&#8221; gasped he, waving his hands.
&#8220;Take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything that you see in the way of a
reward. You are entitled to it. You win
every prize in the show.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no doubt but that the affair is
exceedingly humorous,&#8221; said Kenyon. He
poured out some Scotch, added a little hot
water and sugar, and stirred the mixture
meditatively. &#8220;But, do you know, I can&#8217;t see
it. I suppose our points of view are different.&#8221;
He sipped the toddy, found it to his
satisfaction, and then added: &#8220;However, I
fancy that we have been over all that before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humorous!&#8221; exclaimed Webster. &#8220;Why,
it&#8217;s riotous. Your matter-of-fact acceptance
of the situation is really the funniest thing I
ever saw. But,&#8221; and his manner changed to
one of curiosity, &#8220;how did you get out of Farbush&#8217;s
house without having the police called
upon?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>&#8220;I hardly think there was any chance of
that, at the worst. But, as it was, I simply
laid low, as we used to say at school. Farbush
stormed and raved and threatened down
below, and waved his revolver for a time,
while the others protested. I could not quite
gather what it was about, for they all spoke
at once. But it had something to do with the
safe, for they all three came up the stairs, I
lying snug behind an offset in the wall while
they entered the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, when Farbush saw the result of
your acetylene flame, I suppose there was a
renewal of the tempest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It had begun when I slipped down the
stairs,&#8221; answered Kenyon. &#8220;But I was
safely out at the front door, and on my way
down Fifth Avenue, I suppose, before it
reached its height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The estate of Stephen Austin,&#8221; mused
Webster. &#8220;That, apparently, is what all this
trouble is about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From the clever moves of the girl who
plucked the envelope from my hands in Farbush&#8217;s
office, and her anxiety to get safely
away with it, I should think so myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can hardly understand how she got into
the office&mdash;unless there was more than one
door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was not.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>&#8220;But you saw her leave the room, and you
locked the door behind her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I locked the door, yes. But I did <i>not</i> see
her leave the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster looked at his friend inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I distinctly remember you saying that she
walked to the door and blew out the candle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely; but I said nothing about seeing
her leave the room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George!&#8221; Webster slapped his knee
suddenly. &#8220;It was a bluff. She did not go
out, at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; she was in the office all the time I
worked upon the safe. I reasoned the matter
out afterwards. While she was fumbling
with the combination, she must have caught
sight of me. It was a shadow, perhaps, or
more likely my reflection in the polished door
of the safe. When she covered her face with
her hands, I thought she was crying of disappointment;
but really she must have been
stifling a scream, or shrewdly thinking up a
plan of action.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer the last,&#8221; stated Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she arose, took up the candle, and
walked toward the door. Every step plainly
said that she had given up the fight, that she
had no further hope. Almost in the doorway,
she blew the candle out. I naturally
supposed that she went on; instead, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
darted behind something in the office,&mdash;there
were lots of things that would screen her,&mdash;and
so waited until I had found what she appeared
to want so badly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever!&#8221; exclaimed Webster, emphatically.
&#8220;She has nerve, too. Not one girl in
a thousand could think so clearly under such
circumstances. Do you know, I&#8217;m almost
sorry that she was caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem rather provoking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this young man, Forrester, was on
the premises all the time. I suppose he was
a guest, and was hidden away much after
your own style.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But old Farbush was the wise fox, eh?
He suspected something and probably was
lying in wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s more than likely that the coveted
packet immediately passed back into his
hands when he confronted the pair in front of
the rifled safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon muttered a reply that was not intelligible.
He was drawing steadily at his
cigar, holding it clinched between his teeth,
and frowning thoughtfully. Webster had noticed
his replies being rather brief and absent
for the last few minutes, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the new one, Ken; you might as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
well tell it all. You can&#8217;t surprise me any
more than you have already done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was thinking that, on the whole, I would
have done a great deal better if I had waited
awhile before leaving Farbush&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why? You might have been caught.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course; I would have been taking a
chance. But, then, what else had I been doing
during the entire night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true. But what do you suppose
a little lingering on the scene would have
brought you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have confirmed a suspicion that
I&#8217;ve had ever since. And that is, that Anna
and Forrester met with the surprise of their
lives when the office lights were turned on and
they saw the safe broken open.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, great C&aelig;sar! Ken; how could that be.
The girl, according to your own reasoning,
saw you crack the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go too fast, old chap; I didn&#8217;t say
so. I didn&#8217;t mention any names; for I&#8217;m
not altogether sure that it was Anna who
was in the office with me. The girl who
snatched the packet wore a heavy cloak and
a hood; Anna was in white when I saw her a
moment later as she stood beside Forrester in
the lower hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she might have thrown the cloak off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it would have been upon the stairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
and I would have seen it. She had not time
to dispose of it in any other way, even had
there been a reason for it. From the time
that the light was switched off in the office,
until it was turned on in the hall below, was
only a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you heard the footsteps on the stairs&mdash;and
there was only one girl below.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was only one girl <i>below</i>, yes. And
I heard the footsteps on the stairs. But there
was also a pair of stairs leading to the floor
above. The girl who snatched the packet
may have gone up; I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster stared for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said he, slowly. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning
to get hold. There were two girls in
the house; and you are inclined to suspect
that it was the girl called Dallas who was
with you in the office.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; wonderingly, &#8220;there must
have been three different designs upon the
safe going forward at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon shrugged his shoulders and took
another cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it possible for any merely
human mind to get at the true inwardness of
this strange game. At one moment the people
engaged seem entirely in cahoots; in the
next they are apparently making off-side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
plays of a decided personal nature. We have
discussed their attitudes toward each other
before, and the thing is beyond reason. Forrester
is a friend to Dallas. He wishes her
well, at any rate, as far as I can see. And yet
he is a firm friend and stands high in the
favor of Hong Yo, who would, I have no
doubt, murder her in cold blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I said some time since that the
thing is a puzzle,&#8221; spoke Webster. &#8220;And I
have had no reason to change my mind. But
what do you propose to do next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think a visit to Bellevue might have
some results. Either of the two of my remaining
namesakes might be able to talk to
visitors by this time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>A short time later they were engaged with
the same youthful surgeon whom they had
spoken with before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you have heard of the fate of
the man from Butte,&#8221; said he after he had
greeted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead, is he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; fished out of the East River the
other morning. And they found a new wound
upon him&mdash;a knife thrust through the heart.
It really is the most remarkable series of
events that ever came under my notice. It
would seem as though there was a conspiracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
of some sort on foot; and the people behind
it do not value human life very highly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; answered Kenyon,
dryly. &#8220;But how are the other patients?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Number two, as I call the one hailing
from West Point, is still in rather a bad way,
but is recovering. The one from Saginaw
left the hospital this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is still in New York?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; he can be found at the Hotel
Suisse on Third Avenue.&#8221;</p>

<p>They thanked the surgeon and departed.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cabman should know of the Hotel
Suisse,&#8221; suggested Webster.</p>

<p>So one was summoned, and it proved that
he had the necessary information. A rapid
drive landed them in front of a small, clean-looking
hotel in the neighborhood of the
Cooper Union. A stout German with a
gleaming bald head was at the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dot Kenyon?&#8221; replied he, in answer
to their inquiries. &#8220;<i>Ja</i>, I know him! He
have der room dhirty-dhree got. He is a
young kind of a fellar und has a pandage
aroundt his head. <i>Nicht wahr?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the man. Can he be seen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will findt me oud.&#8221;</p>

<p>A colored boy was summoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mistah Kenyon is in de pool-room, sah,&#8221;
he informed the clerk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;All ride. Jusdt show dese chentlemens
pack dere, yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the person they sought perched
upon a window-sill, intently watching a game
of billiards. He was a compactly-built youth
of about twenty-two or three, neatly dressed,
and with the flattened nose and swollen ear of
the prize-fighter. He slipped down from his
perch, and at their invitation went with them
to a quiet corner of the room. When he
found that they were looking for information
upon the subject of the attack made upon
him, he at once manifested great interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Police business?&#8221; inquired he.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; we have private reasons for seeking
information in this matter,&#8221; answered Kenyon.
&#8220;Anything you can tell us will be appreciated
in the proper way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little pugilist&#8217;s eyes snapped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s good talk!&#8221; exclaimed he.
&#8220;You see, pal, I&#8217;m a stranger in a strange
land, and my roll ain&#8217;t any too thick. New
York is no place, just now, for a man in my
line; and even if it was, I couldn&#8217;t take anyone
on, the way I&#8217;m fixed here,&#8221; and he tapped
his bandaged head significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your name is Kenyon, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, neighbor, it is and it isn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve
used it ever since I broke into this mixing
business, but my right name is Farral. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
see, I was raised in Kenyon, Iowa, and when
I found myself looking around for a name to
put upon the fight cards in Chi. a few years
ago, why, I just picked the name of my old
town. Young Kenyon is a name the sporting
editors know, and,&#8221; with some pride, &#8220;they
also know that I work hard at me job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about this errand of yours to
New York,&#8221; invited Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s where you stick me, bo; that&#8217;s
a little passage that&#8217;s got me tied hand and
foot! Ever since I got that letter I&#8217;ve been
trying to dope it out, but it won&#8217;t work into
shape, no matter how hard I try; I&#8217;m not
strong on the think thing, anyhow, just at the
present time. There&#8217;s something like bees
gets to buzzing in my top whenever I overdo
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can tell us just how the thing
came about, can&#8217;t you? That will not require
you to do much thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure, I can tell it to youse,&#8221; cheerfully.
&#8220;But there ain&#8217;t a lot to tell, at that.
You see, it&#8217;s this way: I&#8217;m sitting in my
room one morning, fixing up a black eye that
I got in a job the night before. Me landlady
knocks on the door and chucks a letter over
the transom. I opens it, see? Quick! for I
think it might be more work, and work is the
thing I&#8217;m looking for. The letter is from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
guy named Forrester, and he tells me to move
East as far as New York in a hurry. He
allows that he&#8217;s got a good thing for me and
encloses a check for expenses.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in South Bend. The time named is
the next night; so I packs me bag and takes
the cushions for the big town, right on the
jump. I don&#8217;t know Forrester, you see, but
money talks every time. I didn&#8217;t know how
good the thing was that was waiting for me
either, but figured it out as a soft proposition
with plenty of backing that the guy wants me
to clean up for.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m cheerful and neighborly when they
dump me into Jersey City; I cross the river
the same way, and I whistle all the way uptown.
Then when I duck into this Selden&#8217;s
Square place I gets my bumps. That&#8217;s about
all there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did Forrester not mention the nature of
the work he had for you to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t mention anything except his
own name and the house in Selden&#8217;s Square.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon glanced at Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;This one seems to have been told less than
the fellow from Butte,&#8221; remarked the latter.
&#8220;I wonder why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the other one insisted upon
knowing more before he made a move.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little pugilist looked interested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;Say,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;if youse can put me hep
on the game, I&#8217;d be obliged. There is something
coming to a couple of stick-up guys for
trimming me that night, and I&#8217;d like to settle
the bill when I&#8217;m fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say that we can tell you little
or nothing; we are vastly interested ourselves
for certain reasons, but can learn nothing
definite. However, this much I&#8217;m sure of.
One of the men who had a hand in laying you
out is a New York crook called the Stalker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Stalker, eh? I&#8217;ll remember that.
In a little while my lid will be all right and
I&#8217;ll hunt him up. And if I find him, he&#8217;ll get
plenty. Make a note of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon handed the youth a sum of money
that caused a broad grin to spread itself
across his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pal,&#8221; said he, &#8220;yous&#8217;er all fineo. It takes
a sport to pass it along that way. And that&#8217;s
no hop vision. Say,&#8221; warming up, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet
yous&#8217;er a friend of the young lady who was to
see me at Bellevue yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought you were a stranger in New
York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right So I am. Me, the perfect
stranger, see? I haven&#8217;t a friend between
here and Pittsburg. The girl is new to me.
But she was there with the bells on, just the
same. I know a real one when I see her, even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
if I don&#8217;t mix with the motor-car owners. I
thinks she&#8217;s a friend of yours because she
treated me right, and because she asked me
about the same line of questions as you
handed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is possible that I know her. Did she
tell you her name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. And her address.&#8221; He took a
card from his pocket and read:</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Dallas Gilbert</span>,<br />
<i>The Girls&#8217; Club, Mulberry Street</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked up and continued: &#8220;It&#8217;s one of
these things that rich girls get up for poor
ones. And she said she was there every
Wednesday and Friday night; and she also
hinted, if I ever found anything out about this
Selden&#8217;s Square thing, to drop around there
and tell her about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ll ask you to do the same,&#8221; said
Kenyon. He wrote the name of his hotel on
one of his own cards and handed it to the
pugilist. &#8220;It&#8217;ll be worth your while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So her name is Gilbert, eh?&#8221; said Webster,
when they reached the street. &#8220;And
she&#8217;s a girl addicted to helping the poor. I
say, Kenyon, that sounds rather good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon looked at his watch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be saying good-night,&#8221; remarked he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not quite 9.30, and I&#8217;ll probably get
there at a decent time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get where?&#8221; asked the astonished Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to this Mulberry Street Club, of
course. It is Friday night, you see. I have
a few straightforward words to say to Miss
Gilbert about a certain packet, and I&#8217;m going
to say them at once.&#8221;</p>

<small>AT THE GIRLS&#8217; CLUB IN MULBERRY STREET</small></h2>


<p class="center">&#8220;If the instinct prompts you to mistrust&mdash;obey. For<br />
instincts are the whisperings of the gods.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>A Maxim of Hong Yo.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Steele Kenyon</span> found the Girls&#8217; Club without
a great deal of trouble. It was a new
and solid-looking building and from top to
bottom every window gleamed with lights.
He made inquiries of a sergeant of police who
happened along upon his round of inspection.
The sergeant was a ruddy-faced, white-haired
man with the hale look of that type of old
New Yorker whose reminiscences never went
above Canal Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;That club,&#8221; said the silver-haired sergeant,
&#8220;is one of the finest things in the city;
and the women who carry it on deserve every
kind of credit. You know how girls are
brought up in some parts of the East Side;
they don&#8217;t get any kind of training; they are
not taught to do any useful work in their
homes. They get to know the inside of workshops
pretty early, and what they hear there,
sometimes, is not the best thing for them.
Then come the dances, the drink and the
street.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>&#8220;And this is the class of girls that forms
the membership of the club?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For the most part. And it helps them a
lot. If they have a talent it is developed, if
they have a liking it is encouraged. And
there is nothing preachy or goody-goody
about the place. That&#8217;s the secret of its success.
They will teach a girl to dance just as
readily as they&#8217;ll teach one to spell. I think
the secretary, Miss Gilbert, is responsible for
most of the successful features. She&#8217;s a
wonderful young lady.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant was about to pass on; then
paused and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are thinking of helping the club
along with a contribution, why, do it. You&#8217;ll
make no mistake. It&#8217;s the real goods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite an idea,&#8221; mused Kenyon, after the
policeman had gone. &#8220;By George, it&#8217;s the
very thing for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been standing upon the opposite
side; so now he crossed the street and entered
the building. A group of girls were in the
hall, muffling themselves up, for the night was
cold for the time of year. At sight of the
tall, elegantly attired young man, they set up
a subdued whispering and giggling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am inclined to suspect that male visitors
are not very common, here,&#8221; thought Kenyon,
with a good-humored smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>One of them, a dark-skinned, black-eyed
girl, who plainly showed her Neapolitan
blood, approached him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you want to see anyone, please?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The secretary, Miss Gilbert,&#8221; answered
he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll find her in the office,&#8221; directed the
black-eyed girl, pointing to an open door
across the hall. &#8220;Walk right in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; He entered at the door indicated
and found himself in an apartment
lighted only by a shaded cluster of bulbs
which hung low over a big desk in the centre
of the floor. The shade threw the light downward
upon a girl whose beautifully posed
head and great mass of dark hair immediately
told him who she was. She was bent
over the desk, writing; and without looking
up, she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon afterwards admitted that at that
moment his heart was pounding as it had
never pounded before; but when he answered,
his voice was calm and assured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come to see the secretary,&#8221; said he,
&#8220;and was told I&#8217;d find her here.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the first sound of his voice she started
and lifted her head. The light showed him
the color leave her face and then stream back,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
brilliantly. The surprise was a sharp one,
but she did not lose the air of proud self-possession
which seemed so natural to her.
However, when she spoke, there was a slight
break in her voice, a fact which she noticed
and which caused her evident annoyance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the secretary,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; He took a forward step. The
light now fell upon him also, and showed a
look of mild surprise. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you state your business,&#8221; she asked,
coldly. &#8220;I have a great deal to do, and it is
getting late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; bowing. &#8220;I have recently
heard good reports of this work, and had
thought to send the treasurer a check if I
found them verified.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour is rather unconventional,&#8221; she
answered. And as he looked at her he could
have sworn that he saw a quick flash of
amusement in the dark eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be the light,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;It
sometimes plays tricks like that.&#8221; Then he
continued, aloud, &#8220;I fancy that unconventionality
is as a rule the usual thing with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit down?&#8221; She pointed to a
chair beside the desk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He seated himself and she regarded him
with serious attention. Not since the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
surprise had she betrayed the slightest sign
of ever having seen him before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are always glad to have people investigate
us,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A great deal of money
is paid out of our fund during the year, and,
of course, it is necessary that more should
come in if the work is to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; replied he.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are people who contribute regularly,&#8221;
she proceeded. &#8220;These help us a very
great deal. But what they give is not nearly
enough; and we are pleased to have new interest
aroused, even if it is only passing.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a curiously questioning look in
her face as she spoke. Kenyon noticed, but
did not understand it. At first he thought it
might mean eagerness for the work in which
she was engaged. But he dismissed that, instantly.
The club and its welfare had no
part in her thoughts at the present moment&mdash;he
felt confident of that; it was other matters&mdash;the
events of the night before, perhaps&mdash;that
interested her.</p>

<p>&#8220;And she is speaking by rote,&#8221; he told himself.
&#8220;All that she&#8217;s saying are the self-evident
things that require no attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>While these things were passing through
his mind she had continued on in the same
strain, speaking rapidly and clearly, but
wearing the same look of interest in something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
foreign to her subject. Suddenly this
changed. His observant eyes saw it give
place to a new eagerness that all but set her
a-tremble. She opened a drawer in her desk
and took out a book.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is customary,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for visitors
to sign their names here,&#8221; placing the book
before him. &#8220;Complying with this does not
indicate their willingness to contribute,&#8221;
quickly; &#8220;it merely enables us to keep track
of those who have shown sufficient interest to
make inquiries.&#8221; She dipped a pen in the
ink and held it out to him. &#8220;Will you write
your name and address, please?&#8221;</p>

<p>He took the pen, and a glimmer of humor
appeared in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what happens after I sign?&#8221; he
asked himself. &#8220;It appears to be a lucky
thought of some sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spread his bold signature across the
first blank line and placed the name of his
hotel under it. Then she took the book and
carefully blotted the page; watching her
keenly he saw the fixed attention which she
gave what he had written, and again saw the
swift color sweep into her face. Then she
placed the book carefully in the desk, once
more, and leaning back in the office chair
looked at him. He gasped in rapture; for
she was smiling.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>&#8220;Do you know, Mr. Kenyon,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I
cannot altogether get rid of the notion that
you had other things in your mind that you
have not mentioned, when you came here to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite possible,&#8221; returned he, coolly.
&#8220;Under certain circumstances one does not
immediately plunge into the matters which
interest one most.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came to ask certain questions, did
you not?&#8221; She placed her elbows upon the
desk and her chin in her palms. For the first
time Kenyon noticed the beauty of her hands.
&#8220;Questions upon matters on which you think
information might be of service to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221; His admiration blunted his
observation; he did not notice that she was
entertained by his even manner. &#8220;There is
information which I fancy would relieve my
mind to a greater or less extent. There are
facts which have been dancing on ahead of
me, so to speak, too elusive to grasp, but interesting
enough to make it worth while to
try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand. And it might be
some balm to you to know that you have not
been alone in this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think,&#8221; said Kenyon, slowly,
&#8220;that you refer to yourself. It is not possible.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>She raised her brows inquiringly, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;A girl of your parts should find no difficulty
in obtaining information. There is a
bird, I believe, that always waits until some
other bird has built a nest. Then it calmly
takes possession. I have always thought this
a serviceable talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be more illuminative. A man runs
a desperate risk and works very hard to
achieve a certain thing. When the victory is
in his hands, a woman snatches it from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a gasp of wonder; her great,
startled eyes searched his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was you!&#8221; she said. &#8220;It was you&mdash;last
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And, I think,&#8221; smiled he, &#8220;that it was
also you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were masked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A masked
burglar!&#8221; There was terror in her manner
and voice, and she shrank a little from him.
&#8220;I did not recognize you; I was too frightened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were not too frightened to remain
and lay a little plan to beat me out,&#8221; remarked
he, and there was an admiration in
his tone that caused her to flush rosily. &#8220;But,
then,&#8221; slowly, &#8220;it was, somehow, about the
sort of thing I would have expected of you.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
Miss Anna did not seem at all the girl for
such an undertaking, though of course I
thought at first it was she.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why <i>of course</i>?&#8221; she asked, a little resentfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because of her manner last night, when I
talked with her on the stairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talked with her&mdash;on the stairs!&#8221;</p>

<p>She half arose in her chair. But almost instantly
she recovered her self-possession,
though the wide-open eyes told plainly of the
excitement that her words had betrayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I had not heard of it,&#8221; she said, trying
to smile. &#8220;It sounds interesting; pray tell
me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no great story. Anna was frightened
when she met me on the stairs leading to the
second floor; she said some things that meant
nothing, but her manner caused me to suspect
much. Later I was convinced that I was
right, by her stealing downstairs to assure
herself that I was gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did you suspect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That there was another design upon the
safe beside my own&mdash;that she had someone
concealed in the house who was to help her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, that can&#8217;t be true. Anna knows
nothing of the packet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you and she were not partners, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
to speak; you knew nothing of her movements?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so impressed with the notion that
she was about to attempt some secret design,
that when you caught the glimmer of my
torch in the dark hall and came to the office
door, I felt sure that it was she.&#8221;</p>

<p>A startled look came upon the face of Dallas;
her voice was low and frightened as she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;When was this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I began operations upon the safe.
Don&#8217;t you remember? You opened the office
door and listened. You could see nothing,
the darkness was so thick. You were frightened;
and you whispered: &#8216;Who&#8217;s there?&#8217;
Then you went slowly down the hall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard this?&#8221; she demanded, and her
face was pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221; He regarded her curiously; then
a thought struck him. &#8220;By George, it was
she after all. She must have stolen away to
find Forrester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forrester!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. He was there. I saw them
together in the lower hall immediately after
you snatched the packet and ran. And Farbush
was standing before them wild with passion,
and with a revolver in his hand.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>Without a word Dallas arose, went swiftly
to a small bookcase at the farther side of the
room, and opened a secret and cunningly contrived
drawer at its base. Then she turned
and he saw that her face was as white as
death.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone!&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not&mdash;?&#8221; he could not finish.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, the packet.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood for a moment overwhelmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are sure that it is gone?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;Look again!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;No use. I am quite sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you are positive that you placed it
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was the safest place I knew of,&#8221; she
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the drawer is a secret one! Who
knew of it beside yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna, only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and a look of intelligence came into
his face. &#8220;And when was she here last?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Less than an hour ago.&#8221;</p>

<small>KENYON SHOWS HIS METAL</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;He is a young man of quick observation and sure judgment.<br />
And once he has made up his mind, he acts like lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>Extract from a letter of Nunez.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Dallas Gilbert and Steele
Kenyon stood looking into each other&#8217;s face
in silence; each was reading a suspicion akin
to their own.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to think that Anna has the
packet,&#8221; stated Kenyon, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; cried the girl. &#8220;Oh, I
have always hated myself for not believing in
her! She seemed so child-like in some things,
and she is so clinging and pretty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Then there has always been a sort
of distrust of her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I could not make up my mind, at
times, that she was quite sincere; I often
thought that I detected a hidden purpose in
her apparently artless questions. Once or
twice I have noticed&mdash;&#8221; But she paused,
hesitatingly, then broke out: &#8220;But I must
not talk this way to you. You do not understand
the situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are a great many things, as I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
had occasion to remark upon one or two
previous occasions, that I do not understand
in this case,&#8221; said he, smiling.</p>

<p>Again he saw hesitancy in her eyes; then
she suddenly held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask your pardon,&#8221; she said, simply.</p>

<p>Quickly he took the hand; but his manner
told her that he did not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;For things that I have said, and things
that I have done. I did not believe in you&mdash;then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you to be a brave man.&#8221;</p>

<p>A slight shadow came upon his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are many sorts of brave men,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Some of the greatest villains have
been as courageous as lions.&#8221; She understood
and hung her head. &#8220;Do you know,&#8221;
he went on, &#8220;I think I have been much more
generous than you in this matter. You have
come upon some sort of evidence that has
proven to you that I am not an out and out
blackguard; and so, in part, you have repented
your first opinion of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She colored, but her beautiful eyes were
lifted to meet his, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not require any evidence to prove
your worth to me,&#8221; Kenyon continued. &#8220;You
suspected me because you were convinced
that I was associated with Hong Yo and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
others. I had every reason to believe the
same of you&mdash;at first&mdash;but I did not.&#8221;</p>

<p>An impulsive answer seemed to tremble
upon her lips; her eyes shone through the
gathering tears. But she held herself in
check.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you nothing now,&#8221; she said,
and her voice faltered a little. &#8220;Because it
would seem so strange and unconvincing. I
am but a girl, and for months have been circumstanced
as a girl has never been before.
When one is constantly surrounded by hidden
dangers and secret foes, one fears to trust&mdash;anyone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could do something to make you
trust me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is not enough for a
man to have a girl tell him that she thinks him
brave. Mere courage is not an uncommon
thing. I don&#8217;t know what this evidence is
that you have discovered in my favor, but I
do know that it must be incomplete. I do not
ask to know the meaning of any of the strange
things that I have encountered during the
past week. All I know is that, somehow, and
for some reason, you are engaged in a sort of
warfare with a number of men. Let me complete
the testimony. Let me fight upon your
side and convince you that I am honest, as
well as brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long time&mdash;it seemed minutes to Kenyon&mdash;she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
searched his face. Then with sudden
resolve she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I will. I accept you as a recruit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; exclaimed Kenyon, &#8220;will serve
you as I never served a leader before! Name
the deeds that you desire done,&#8221; laughing,
&#8220;and I shall do them.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her face was grave; indeed, discouragement
was written heavily upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so helpless to deal with it all,&#8221;
she almost sobbed, suddenly breaking down.
&#8220;It is more than a girl&#8217;s work. At every
turn I see things that appear beyond my
strength to overcome. I cannot plan with
these men; their cunning overmatches mine.
Even at this moment everything seems black.
If Anna took the packet from the secret
drawer, she has turned it over to Griscom
Forrester before this, and he&mdash;&#8221; She paused
suddenly, drawing in her breath in short
gasps, then she sprang toward Kenyon and
grasped his arm. &#8220;Quick, quick!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;The <i>Wizard</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is Griscom Forrester&#8217;s yacht; she lies
in the East River not far from Twenty-third
Street. If she has given him the packet he
will get up steam at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>Like lightning his mind grasped the situation.
He stepped to the desk, took up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
&#8217;phone that stood there, and asked for the
Waldorf-Astoria. With the receiver to his
ear awaiting a reply he turned to her, calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sized yacht is the <i>Wizard</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About seventy tons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And her crew?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, fifteen men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Then he spoke into the
&#8217;phone: &#8220;Ah, is that the Waldorf? I&#8217;d like
to speak to Mr. G. A. Webster, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>While the connection was being made with
Webster&#8217;s apartments, Kenyon said to the
girl, quietly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the &#8217;phone book, and find me the
name Schmelzer.&#8221;</p>

<p>She nervously took up the book and began
to flutter the pages. Just then Webster
called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Garry. This is Kenyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, still on the quest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want you to meet me at the foot of
Twenty-third Street, East River, as soon as
you can get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a snort of astonishment at the
Waldorf end of the wire. Then Webster
demanded, excitedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s doing, Ken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There promises to be plenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; exultantly. &#8220;I&#8217;m with you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>&#8220;Good; ring off, and call an auto. You
can&#8217;t get there too quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon hung up and turned to Dallas.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laid the directory before him and indicated
a list of names. He ran his finger along
this, and then gave an exclamation of satisfaction.
Schmelzer, who kept the pool-room
in Pell Street, also possessed a telephone; so
in a few moments he was talking to the ex-divekeeper,
Gypsy Brady.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want the men for?&#8221; asked
the latter, after some talk.</p>

<p>&#8220;A tough job, perhaps. And I want tough
men. The pay will be large.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m your man,&#8221; answered Brady. &#8220;The
large pay is the thing that counts. I&#8217;ll be at
the place with the bunch as soon as you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Calmly, and without the slightest indication
of hurry, Kenyon called up a neighboring
garage and ordered a motor-car; then he had
himself connected with the information-desk
of a popular newspaper, and received much
concise information upon the subject of
power-boats and where they were to be had.
Person after person was summoned over the
humming wire; then he hung up, finally, with
a satisfied air.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have done about all I can do in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the way of precaution,&#8221; said he, smiling. &#8220;If
the matter stands as you think, I will be
ready to offer some sort of opposition to Mr.
Forrester&#8217;s departure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are wonderful!&#8221; she said. And then
she threw back her head and laughed.</p>

<p>It was as though all her anxiety and fear
had been dissolved before the sudden rush of
his thorough personality. In an instant he
had assumed all her cares; she felt herself
strangely at peace and weakly willing to allow
him to bear the weight of everything. His
masculine grasp and sharp military decisions
had wonderfully comforted and soothed her.</p>

<p>Kenyon as he looked at her gathered some
of this, and his heart beat swiftly. It was the
sort of thing that tells heavily with a woman;
and he had progressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can succeed,&#8221; was his thrilling
thought, &#8220;there will be no one stand higher
than I! And I <i>will</i> succeed!&#8221;</p>

<p>He heard the gruff grunting of the car&#8217;s
signal outside; and he turned to Dallas, catching
up his hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go; the men whom I have engaged
will be waiting for me; and then Forrester
must not be given too much time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pinned on her hat and took her long
coat from a chair where it had been thrown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye,&#8221; said he.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going with you,&#8221; she told him, briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why so?&#8221; She drew herself up in
that proud fashion which he had come to
know so well; the head lifted imperiously and
the beautiful eyes flashed.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be danger, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, scornfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Danger! Am I not accustomed to danger?
The past week has been crowded with
perils that I could not see. This, to-night,
will be at least visible.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her with quick admiration.
And at that moment he learned that it was
her spirit and not her beauty alone that drew
him to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are determined?&#8221; he asked, after a
short pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without another word he led her out to the
car which stood at the curb. The night had
turned overcast, and a damp wind blew from
the east.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a bad night upon the river,&#8221;
commented Kenyon.</p>

<p>He assisted her into the huge car.</p>

<p>&#8220;Foot of Twenty-third Street, East,&#8221; he
said to the driver. &#8220;And make good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>They spoke hardly a word all the way uptown;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
when the foot of Twenty-third Street
was reached Kenyon noticed another car.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be Webster,&#8221; he exclaimed.
Sure enough, in the tonneau he espied Garry,
enveloped in a huge overcoat and holding a
cigar between his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Kenyon,&#8221; cried that young gentleman,
removing the cigar and waving his
hand. &#8220;Here I am, on deck and waiting!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would be!&#8221; Kenyon&#8217;s car
drew up beside the other. &#8220;Mr. Webster&mdash;Miss
Gilbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl inclined her head, but Webster, so
great was his astonishment, blundered woefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great C&aelig;sar!&#8221; was his mental exclamation.
&#8220;Kenyon&#8217;s coming along, sure enough.
And she <i>is</i> a beauty. I never saw such eyes
and such a great lot of dark hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait here for us,&#8221; said Kenyon to his
driver. Then to Webster he added: &#8220;And
you&#8217;d better have your fellow wait, also; we
may need him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He helped Dallas out, and the three of them
made their way to a pier close by. Webster
never asked a question; he knew that something
of great importance was expected to
occur, or Kenyon would never have summoned
him. And then the presence of Dallas
Gilbert lent an air of suspense to the thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
which he would not have broken for the
world.</p>

<p>From a dusky spot along the pier a man
arose and approached them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenyon?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Are you the man I spoke
to over the &#8217;phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon was brusque and direct; for in
times of emergency the old military habit was
difficult to shake off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I keep the public boat-house
down below here a piece.&#8221; Then he turned
and pointed out into the stream. &#8220;I gave an
eye to the yacht <i>Wizard</i> as you told me.
That&#8217;s her out there with all the lights going.
Some people boarded her about a half hour
ago; I had a night glass on her, and I think
they are trying to get up steam in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you the glass with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. Here it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>The east wind had driven the murk in
masses above the city; and along the waters
of the river a sort of thickening was noticeable
in the darkness. But Kenyon&#8217;s keen
eyes and the night glass managed to gather
the salient features of the proceedings aboard
the <i>Wizard</i>. Steam was up and the anchor
was being weighed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you get us out to her before she
starts?&#8221; asked Kenyon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>The boatman looked at the yacht through
the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late,&#8221; said he, positively. &#8220;She&#8217;ll
be off before I could get you to the launch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon handed the man a bill, the size of
which made him stare; then with Dallas and
Webster he hurried back to the place where
they had left the cars. A group of men stood
upon a corner not far from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, there are my fellows, now,&#8221; said Kenyon,
in a tone of satisfaction. &#8220;Everything
is moving on schedule. Take my car with
Miss Gilbert, Webster, while I speak to
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode over to the group. There were
seven altogether, and Gypsy Brady and Big
Slim were among them.</p>

<p>&#8220;How are you, pal?&#8221; saluted the latter.
&#8220;I&#8217;m taking a chance, being out, but I need
the money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the game?&#8221; inquired the Gypsy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jump into that car, there, the lot of you,&#8221;
directed Kenyon, shortly, pointing to the
machine that Webster had arrived in. As
they scrambled in, hurriedly, he continued to
the driver: &#8220;Follow the other car; keep close
behind, or you might lose us in the darkness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he leaped into the car with Dallas
and Webster.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Morris Heights,&#8221; he ordered. &#8220;And let
us see you break a record.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be pinched if we try that,&#8221; protested
the driver.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must take the risk. It is late, and
there are not many people upon the streets,
so there is little danger of an accident. Open
her up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the man, as the big car
swept around. &#8220;The chances are all yours.
I&#8217;m used to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And he followed his instructions to the letter.
The machine was a powerful one, as
was the one behind; and stray pedestrians
were startled to see the two big vehicles flash
by and vanish amid a cloud of dust. Now and
then a policeman waved a frantic club and
shouted; but they never heeded him, burning
the streets until they reached their destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, all of you,&#8221; cried Kenyon to
Gypsy Brady and his followers.</p>

<p>The men tumbled out, as Kenyon paid the
drivers of the ears. Then they all made their
way along the river front, until Kenyon
halted them at a covered pier, the small,
private door to which stood open.</p>

<p>A man with a big ship&#8217;s lantern stood there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenyon&#8217;s party?&#8221; inquired he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Is the <i>Vixen</i> ready?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>&#8220;All but casting off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us get aboard.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were upon the tiny
after-deck of a long, narrow power-boat of
something less than fifteen tons. Brady and
his men were gathered forward and upon the
top of the low cabin. Kenyon saw the last
one aboard; then he handed Dallas down into
the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cast off,&#8221; said he to the men in charge.
&#8220;And let us see what time you can make
between here and North Brother Island.&#8221;</p>

<small>ON BOARD THE VIXEN</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8220;Through the scud and fog, and the flying spray</div>
<div class="verse">We drove all night till the break of the day.</div>

</div></div>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>An Improvisation of Garry Webster.</i></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lines were let go and the boat shoved
off; then the gasoline engine was started, and
after a moment&#8217;s hesitancy in getting under
way, the fleet craft buried its nose in the water
and shot down the Harlem toward East
River.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Garry Webster, in a low tone
to Kenyon; &#8220;now that there seems to be a
moment in which we can take breath, what in
the name of the fire-eyed gods does all this
mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will come down into the cabin,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try and tell you about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dallas sat there, still enveloped in her long
coat; and Kenyon noticed, with a quick shock,
that she was very pale.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not have come,&#8221; said he, and
Webster nodded significantly, aside, at the
gentleness of the tone. &#8220;It has been too
much for you.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>&#8220;Do I look bad?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;But perhaps
it is the lantern light,&#8221; and she smiled
bravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have calculated to catch the <i>Wizard</i>
about North Brother Island,&#8221; said Kenyon.
&#8220;You see the stretch of water from the
Twenty-third Street anchorage to the mouth
of the Harlem is one of the most congested on
earth. A craft is forced to proceed at low
speed at any time, and more especially upon
a dark night like this. The cars brought us
up like hurricanes, and we&#8217;ll get into the big
stream in good time, if nothing goes wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work!&#8221; applauded Webster. &#8220;I
tell you what, Miss Gilbert, it takes Kenyon
to do this sort of thing properly. At college
now, he was especially excellent in planning
things. Do you notice the blush?&#8221; with a
chuckle at his friend&#8217;s secret and impatient
gestures. &#8220;I think modesty is so becoming
in a man, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, indeed,&#8221; smiled the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Garry, before you relapse into a
state of hopeless idiocy,&#8221; remarked Kenyon,
&#8220;pay attention, and I&#8217;ll tell you what has
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>So while Webster listened Kenyon told him
what the reader already knows. When he
had finished Webster arose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Gilbert,&#8221; said he, bowing as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
the swaying of the flying boat would permit,
&#8220;I bend the knee before courage. Now,
that little scene of yours with an apparently
desperate cracksman,&#8221; and his blue eyes
snapped with admiration, &#8220;was one that required
doing, and I tell you what, Ken,&#8221; with
a wise nod toward his friend, &#8220;you should be
mighty glad that it happened. It has set you
right, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>After some further discussion Webster
went upon deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I shall only be able to approach
our conspirators as an open enemy now,&#8221;
said Kenyon to the girl.</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Forrester has the packet, he has
learned what you learned, that I am not the
sort of person I seemed to be. Though,&#8221; and
he looked puzzled, &#8220;Farbush must have
known its contents all along, now that I think
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is nothing in the packet that would
cause them to suspect you of being an honest
man,&#8221; she assured him. &#8220;That is, not unless,&#8221;
and her voice sank a little as she realized
what she was saying, &#8220;they are inclined
to believe it of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>His heart bounded madly and his blood
went tingling through his veins. But he only
said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>&#8220;Thank you. That is kind of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster put his head into the cabin. &#8220;I
say, Kenyon,&#8221; called he, &#8220;the captain would
like to speak with you for a moment. It
looks important.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said the adventurer to the
girl.</p>

<p>He went upon deck. The owner of the
craft, a round-bodied, good-natured looking
man, was at the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Mr. Kenyon,&#8221; spoke he, &#8220;but
your friend here tells me that it is the steam
yacht <i>Wizard</i> that you want to meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her name.&#8221; Kenyon saw that the
man had something to impart, and added:
&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It just happens, sir, that I lay alongside
of the power-boat <i>Piedmont</i> this evening.
And just before I got your message to have
my boat ready, a party comes on board of
her; and from what I heard the engineer say
before they started out, they, too, were going
to meet a steam yacht. And it just happens
that it, also, is the <i>Wizard</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon leaned back against the cabin and
lit a cigarette; Webster shrugged his shoulders.
The group of hard-faced men upon the
top of the cabin listened intently, nodded to
each other, and muttered their opinions of
the cruise upon which they had volunteered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
A clear voice spoke from the little companionway
which caused them all to start and turn.
It was Dallas who stood there, her long coat
and the curling ends of her dark hair blowing
in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of people were they who engaged
this other boat?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A queer looking lot, miss,&#8221; and Kenyon
smiled as he saw the speaker shoot a quick
glance at the group forward. &#8220;About ten all
told, I should think. One of them appeared
to be pretty far gone; they had to carry him
aboard. It was a Chinaman.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at Kenyon and he saw her face
go whiter than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hong Yo,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Oh, if we
only knew what that means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It means, I should think, that Forrester
has summoned his friends,&#8221; said Webster.
&#8220;From what Kenyon has told me, Forrester
and Hong Yo seem to be particularly intimate.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a curious expression upon the
face of Dallas. Kenyon wondered when he
had seen it before, and then suddenly remembered
that it had stolen across her countenance
that night in Selden&#8217;s Square, when she
gazed at Anna at the old man&#8217;s bedside. And
he now recognized it as a species of doubt.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, surely,&#8221; cried Kenyon, &#8220;you do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
think that this move of Forrester&#8217;s is upon
his own hook&mdash;that he is playing the Chinaman
false!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know what to think,&#8221; she replied,
slowly; and though he could not see, because
her head was turned from him, he felt sure
that there were tears in her eyes. &#8220;I have
seen so much treachery of late that my reason
refuses to accept appearances. I have cause
to thank Griscom Forrester, as you know; but
I also have cause to fear him. He may be my
friend, he may be a friend to Hong Yo, or he
may be seeking to further his own personal
ends. I cannot tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Shortly after this she went down into the
cabin once more; and Kenyon and Webster
talked in low tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem,&#8221; remarked the young man
from Chicago, &#8220;that she is not any more sure
about Forrester than you were some days, or
nights, ago. The fellow seems to be a puzzle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will not take a great while now to solve
him,&#8221; answered Kenyon, grimly. &#8220;We are
coming into the East River, and once on the
<i>Wizard&#8217;s</i> deck, I&#8217;ll not waste words.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I don&#8217;t think a little straight talk
will do any harm; the time seems about ripe
for it. But, I say, Ken, doesn&#8217;t she,&#8221; with a
nod toward the cabin, &#8220;do any talking of an
enlightening nature?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>Kenyon frowned and looked down into the
ghost-like billows which the craft was throwing
up upon either side. They frothed for a
moment in the lantern light and then disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>&#8220;To speak the plain truth,&#8221; said he slowly,
&#8220;I doubt if she knows a great deal more than
I can guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what little she might know,&#8221; persisted
Webster, &#8220;she keeps pretty closely to
herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; reluctantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder why. You are upon her side;
you are helping her to win out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. But how can she be sure of that.
You heard what she just said about Forrester?
Yes? Well, consider and weigh it carefully.
Do you suppose that she referred to
him only?&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster opened his eyes widely, and
whistled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean to say that she does not altogether
trust you. Why, I thought you had
become pals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m inclined to think,&#8221; said Kenyon,
&#8220;that she, personally, would place confidence
in me. But she has not, I know, herself, only,
to think of. She seems to fear for others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps the mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
&#8216;he&#8217; whom I have heard referred to now and
then. But whatever it is, the girl fears
treachery. And I suppose she has good
cause to fear it. You heard her say that her
reason refuses to accept appearances. I
have only the appearance of aiding her, as
yet. Another man has befriended her, but
she has cause to suspect him, for all that.
What assurance has she that it will be different
in my case? She even doubts the faith of
the conspirators to each other&mdash;as we have
been inclined to do. How does she know but
what I, too, in spite of all that she has lately
learned, may be one of them, and willing, now,
to throw them all overboard for a personal
advantage. She told me once to-night that
she was circumstanced strangely, and without
a friend who could help her. So you can&#8217;t
blame her for withholding her confidence;
suspicion is her only defence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she trusts herself in your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she not trust herself in the hands of
the others? The girl has courage and is not
afraid to venture anything that promises
results.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster bit the end off a cigar and stooped
into the shelter of the cabin to light it. He
drew at it steadily for a moment after he
arose, then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve got the right idea, old chap.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
You&#8217;ve got to work for her good opinion. But
in spite of all that you might say to the contrary,
I rather fancy you&#8217;ve got a fair sort of
a start. In other words, she&#8217;d rather see you
win than not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon made no reply. However, her
words of a very little while before came back
to him, and his blood thrilled with the renewed
realization of the fact that what Webster
said was true. She had told him that
she wished to believe in him. She had put it
into words; and her manner spoke so plainly.
The way to set every lingering doubt that she
might have regarding him, at rest, was to win;
and he set his teeth and narrowed his eyes as
he looked into the darkness ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s somewhere out there,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;We are coming nearer to it with every moment
that goes by. I do not know whom I
have to fight, or why. But I don&#8217;t care,
either. It&#8217;s for her; and I&#8217;m going to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center">&#8220;This sort of fox is sometimes more than usually cunning.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Long Island Huntsman.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> November mist had settled heavily
upon the East River; and when they ran out
into it, they could hear the foghorns and bells
being tooted and rung all about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad night for making out any craft,&#8221;
remarked the owner of the power-boat. &#8220;We
can&#8217;t see more than a dozen feet on any side
of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man who attended to the engine suddenly
lifted his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the <i>Piedmont</i>,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you can see her, you&#8217;ve got
mighty good sight,&#8221; laughed Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure would,&#8221; returned the man. &#8220;But
I don&#8217;t see her. I hear her. Listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a continuous, snuffling, gasping
sound ahead, and the steady thump of an
engine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could tell that exhaust of hers anywhere,&#8221;
explained the engineer. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
worst on the river.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some time they listened to the coughing
of the <i>Piedmont</i>. The <i>Vixen</i> was barely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
creeping along, for it was impossible to make
any speed; the danger of a collision was too
great.</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to be cruising up and down,&#8221;
said Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; her skipper knows that this is about
the best place to meet any vessel making for
the Sound. They come this way to avoid the
currents around Hell Gate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Backward and forward cruised the <i>Vixen</i>
passing and repassing the <i>Piedmont</i> in the
darkness. Once those on board the latter
seemed to become suspicious, and she crept
forward, her port and starboard lights shining
through the fog.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; cried a voice. &#8220;Who is that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come any nearer,&#8221; replied the
skipper of the <i>Vixen</i>. &#8220;I know how that old
box of yours steers, Morgan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, is that you, Phylen? All right.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the <i>Piedmont</i> crept away again,
resuming her cruising up and down. At this
point Dallas re-appeared upon deck.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard someone calling,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did,&#8221; answered Kenyon. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
come up with the other boat that the captain
was telling us of.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little gasp and looked off in the
direction of the now distant boat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>&#8220;Do you know,&#8221; she whispered in a frightened
sort of way, &#8220;that sound out there
reminds me of the cough of Hong Yo.&#8221; She
had placed her hand upon his arm, and he
could feel the shudder that ran through her.
&#8220;Oh, how I fear that man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have excellent cause. The man from
Butte was close to the truth when he called
him a dying devil.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a quick, surprised glance but
said nothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;The murder of that man was one of the
worst exhibitions of deadly ferocity that I
ever saw&mdash;and my career in South America
was not without its experiences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was dreadful,&#8221; said the girl, shudderingly,
and she covered her face with her
hands.</p>

<p>Now and then a steam vessel would pass
them in the darkness, and the skipper of the
<i>Vixen</i> would hail its deck and draw alongside.
But they were mostly tugs and &#8220;truck&#8221;
boats; as yet no yacht had split the murk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you feel quite sure that she has not yet
gone by?&#8221; asked Webster at length.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m positive of it,&#8221; replied Kenyon.
&#8220;She had not the time. But she should be
due at almost any minute now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark, there!&#8221; cried the skipper; &#8220;do you
hear that whistle?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>There came a low, mournful wailing from
down river.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those toy sirens that some
yachtsmen fit their crafts with,&#8221; the skipper
informed them. &#8220;Like as not this is the
vessel you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; and there goes the <i>Piedmont</i> for
her,&#8221; said Webster. The coughing exhaust
of the unseen power-boat gurgled and volleyed
from ahead; and they could see her port
light streaming dimly through the fog.</p>

<p>At Kenyon&#8217;s order the <i>Vixen</i> swept around
and followed the other boat like a beagle.
Suddenly the lights of a large yacht stared
down at them, from the distance of about
twenty-five yards. Then they heard a shrill
hail from the deck of the <i>Piedmont</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahoy! Is that the <i>Wizard</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>No reply came from the yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! is that the yacht <i>Wizard</i>?&#8221; came
another voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Farbush,&#8221; Kenyon told Webster.</p>

<p>Still there was no answer from the yacht.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s increasing her speed,&#8221; spoke the
skipper of the <i>Vixen</i>. &#8220;Her people don&#8217;t
seem to want to be friendly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bells could be heard jingling from the
engine-room of the larger vessel; the rush of
water around her bow grew greater; then she
shot forward at a swifter rate. The <i>Piedmont&#8217;s</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
lights were seen to swing in pursuit;
and almost at the same moment the <i>Vixen</i>
performed a like man&#339;uvre.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t outfoot us,&#8221; said Kenyon to
Dallas, &#8220;but we may have some trouble stopping
her, if they persist in going ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to do it before we pass City
Island,&#8221; growled the <i>Vixen&#8217;s</i> skipper. &#8220;This
craft can&#8217;t ride the seas that&#8217;s piling into the
Sound to-night. She&#8217;d swamp if we tried to
shove her through.&#8221;</p>

<p>They rushed along until they were almost
overlapping the <i>Wizard&#8217;s</i> stern. However,
they were some thirty or more yards to the
starboard of her; the <i>Piedmont</i> was upon the
port side and apparently directly in her wash.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems as though they were going to try
to lay alongside and board her,&#8221; cried Webster,
suddenly, as he peered through a night
glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll go to the bottom if they make
the attempt,&#8221; prophesied the engineman of
the <i>Vixen</i>. &#8220;They must be damned fools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that,&#8221; said Kenyon,
quietly. &#8220;They are out here to board that
yacht, and it&#8217;s up to them to do the best they
can in the matter. If the people on board the
<i>Wizard</i> refuse to stop, they must take steps
to accomplish their object, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s impossible to get to the deck of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
that vessel at her present speed,&#8221; protested
the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show you in a few minutes that it is
not,&#8221; Kenyon assured him.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; suspiciously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just point her nose toward the yacht&#8217;s
stern. I think I can get her rail in a jump
from the cabin roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could never do it. Another thing,
I&#8217;m not going to give you a chance to try. If
the <i>Vixen</i> once got so far into the wash of
that craft, she&#8217;d be swamped.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a high-pitched voice was heard
crying from the <i>Wizard&#8217;s</i> deck:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sheer off there, you fools, or I&#8217;ll run you
down!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, save for
the beat of the engines and the dashing of the
dark water; then a gunshot roared redly
through the night, followed by a scream of
pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Head her over,&#8221; cried Kenyon, excitedly,
to the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m blessed if I do,&#8221; replied the man,
stubbornly. &#8220;What the devil are you folks
after, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Head her over,&#8221; ordered Kenyon, sternly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied the other. &#8220;And what&#8217;s
more I&#8217;m going to run back to Morris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
Heights. There is something about this thing
that don&#8217;t look right to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will be responsible for any sort of
damage,&#8221; Webster told him, encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do,&#8221; returned
Phylen, whose mind seemed to be made up.
&#8220;Slow her down, Ned,&#8221; to the man at the
engine, &#8220;we are going back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was about to change the course of the
boat when Kenyon&#8217;s powerful grip fell upon
him, and he was dragged away from the
wheel. At the same moment the long frame
of Big Slim slid from the top of the cabin
into the little companionway, blocking the entrance
of the engineman.</p>

<p>&#8220;An engine was once my job,&#8221; he told
Kenyon, coolly. &#8220;Say the word, pal, and
I&#8217;m here to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take charge of these two men,&#8221; directed
Kenyon. And Gypsy Brady and his followers
had the skipper and engineer in their
midst, forward, in a moment. Then, with
Kenyon at the wheel and Slim at the engine,
the <i>Vixen</i> headed toward the flying <i>Wizard</i>.</p>

<p>But the <i>Vixen</i> was a swift boat, and easily
closed the gap between herself and the yacht;
before long they were in the wash alongside
and the spray was drenching them. The leap
from the <i>Vixen&#8217;s</i> cabin top to the <i>Wizard&#8217;s</i>
rail would be no great feat, if they could get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
near enough, for the yacht had a rather low
freeboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take the wheel, Garry,&#8221; said Kenyon, at
last. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to make the try.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster looked aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could no more steer this craft than I
could build a bridge across the Sound,&#8221; confessed
he.</p>

<p>Kenyon felt a firm hand laid upon the
spokes, and shifting his gaze from Webster
found Dallas at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take the wheel,&#8221; said she quietly.
Then, noting his surprise, she added, &#8220;You
need feel no fear. If the vessel will answer,
I&#8217;ll bring her up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good girl!&#8221; exclaimed Webster.</p>

<p>But Kenyon said nothing. He leaped upon
the cabin, and stood gathering himself for the
spring. With the ease of an expert the girl
drove the <i>Vixen</i> close under the starboard
rail of the <i>Wizard</i>, and held her there for a
moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; she cried, clearly.</p>

<p>And Kenyon leaped. A sea struck the bow
at the same moment and destroyed his calculations;
notwithstanding this, however, he
grasped the yacht&#8217;s rail with one hand and
drew himself quickly upon her deck. Then
the Vixen fell off; but still he could hear her
engine pulsing and see her lights glimmering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
through the mist. Then he turned his attention
to the vessel upon whose deck he stood.</p>

<p>All her deck lanterns were lighted. In her
waist a man, breathing heavily, lay stretched
near the bulwarks; another stood at the
wheel, a revolver in his hand, while a third
was at the port rail, also armed with a like
weapon. There came a snapping of firearms,
apparently from the, to Kenyon, invisible
<i>Piedmont</i>. The man at the rail swore furiously
and began firing downward; the other
man left the wheel and joined him in the
fusillade.</p>

<p>&#8220;They seem to be enjoying the pastime
immensely,&#8221; commented Kenyon, under his
breath, &#8220;so it would be a pity to interrupt
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He softly crossed the deck and made his
way down the iron steps leading to the engine-room.
This was also brilliantly lighted; the
engine was throbbing swiftly, but there was
no sign of anyone in charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the better for me,&#8221; muttered the adventurer,
as he dropped his Colt back into his
pocket. &#8220;I suppose the matter upon deck
has them all interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>In an instant he had shut off steam, and the
engine began to slow down; then he ascended
the iron stairs once more and gained the deck.
The revolver shots still continued from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
<i>Piedmont</i>; but those upon the <i>Wizard</i> were
not replying. From the shelter of the housing
Kenyon looked aft. As before, only two
unwounded men were visible, and these, all
unconscious, in their excitement, that the engine
had stopped, were crouched under the
bulwarks reloading their weapons. The <i>Piedmont</i>
had clung to the larger vessel; and now
that she had all but lost her headway, the
attacking party came alongside and leaped
upon the deck of the <i>Wizard</i>.</p>

<p>While the two sailors were being seized,
Kenyon slipped down into the cabin, a strong
suspicion forming in his mind. So when, a
little later, Farbush came bursting in, followed
by Hong Yo, who was assisted by a
couple of men, they found the adventurer
seated coolly in a steamer chair, rolling a
cigarette. And as they stood staring with
eyes of wonder, he looked up and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, gentlemen,&#8221; he greeted, &#8220;how do you
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment neither Hong Yo nor Farbush
was able to speak; then the former
waved his hand in dismissal to the two men
who had helped him down into the cabin;
when they were gone, he turned to Kenyon
once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; asked he, and his deathly face was
set like stone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say that it does not seem to
be at all well,&#8221; replied Kenyon. He lit the
cigarette and pointed to a couple of chairs.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Forrester?&#8221; inquired Farbush.
His face was flushed, and there was anger
and suspicion in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the faintest idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both men sat down and looked at him silently
for a time. Apparently they were
wholly unable to account for him. At length
Hong Yo spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing on board the
<i>Wizard</i>?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;My errand is exactly the same as your
own,&#8221; smiled Kenyon. &#8220;I came to find Forrester.&#8221;</p>

<p>A light of intelligence crossed the countenance
of Farbush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I think I understand!&#8221; exclaimed he.
&#8220;You received my message after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is very seldom that I miss anything of
importance,&#8221; evaded Kenyon, evenly. &#8220;It is
a thing that I have drilled myself to, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And when you learned the circumstances,
you suspected Forrester of the burglary,&#8221;
cried Farbush, triumphantly. &#8220;Hong Yo said
that you would not&mdash;that like himself you had
confidence in the traitor.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>Kenyon drew the cigarette smoke deeply
into his lungs, and expelled it slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am astonished at Hong Yo&#8217;s trusting
anybody,&#8221; commented he.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not trust,&#8221; spoke the Chinaman,
coughing hollowly. &#8220;It was my fixed belief
that it was to his advantage to remain
faithful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A fool can never be trusted even to see an
advantage,&#8221; declared Farbush.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not be quite so confident of his
folly,&#8221; advised Kenyon. &#8220;He seems to have
been shrewd enough to escape us to-night. He
suspected that the yacht would be stopped on
her way out, apparently; so he did not venture
aboard her. And, to gain time possibly,
he sent her out in charge of three of her crew.
There is no knowing where he has gone in the
meantime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you searched the yacht?&#8221; asked
Farbush.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he may be aboard, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>A half-dozen men searched the <i>Wizard</i>
from end to end; but, as Kenyon had reasoned,
Forrester was not on board. Steam
was gotten up and the <i>Wizard</i> was headed
toward Pelham Bay, the two power-boats following
in her wake.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>&#8220;That, then, was your boat that we heard
all along,&#8221; said Farbush, as he leaned over
the <i>Wizard&#8217;s</i> stern rail, his eyes upon the two
low-lying, shadowy crafts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very likely, you did hear us,&#8221; answered
Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem to have quite a crew on board
of her,&#8221; commented Farbush, peering through
the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Like yourself I was not at all
sure as to what resistance I&#8217;d meet with. Success
only comes to the ready man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a great beam of white light shot
across the water and brought all three vessels
into strong relief. It was the searchlight at
Fort Schuyler; the firing had evidently been
heard, and they were endeavoring to locate
the trouble. At the first swinging sweep of
the light the <i>Vixen&#8217;s</i> decks were flooded.
Kenyon saw Gypsy Brady and his followers
still grouped about the rebellious skipper and
engineer; at the wheel was a slim, girlish
figure enveloped in the long coat, and near
by was Garry Webster.</p>

<p>At the first flash Farbush uttered an exclamation;
then he turned upon Kenyon with
distorted face and upraised hand, his whole
frame shaking with what looked like fury.
For a moment he stood thus, glaring at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
imperturbable adventurer. Then his hand
dropped and the look gave place to a smile,
while he said, hurriedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;What the devil! That confounded light
almost startled me out of my wits!&#8221;</p>

tree, and told him many things that he had not heard before.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Amazing Adventures of Mansour Bi.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> had been after dawn when Kenyon
reached his hotel, and he had slept all day.
So it was about six in the evening when he
arose and bathed and shaved and put on a
well-fitting business suit of gray which his
tailor had lately delivered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been living in my evening clothes of
late,&#8221; said he; &#8220;and it feels rather good to
get into something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>A knock came upon the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>A bell-hop opened the door, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;A gentleman to see you, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon looked at the card. It contained
the name:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>PHILIP AUSTIN.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Again it begins,&#8221; muttered he. Then to
the boy he said: &#8220;Send him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lad closed the door, and Kenyon threw
the card upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had intended to have a turn at hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
up that last name,&#8221; said he. &#8220;But this will
probably save me the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few moments later a stout, stoop-shouldered
young man was ushered in. He stuck a
pair of glasses upon his nose and looked Kenyon
over carefully. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Kenyon, I thought it as well to call
upon you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite right,&#8221; returned the adventurer,
affably. &#8220;Will you sit down?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the lights were turned on and Kenyon
inspected his visitor with the same care that
the latter had bestowed upon himself. As he
sat holding out his hands toward the gas logs,
for the November evening was decidedly cold,
he looked small and placid and good-humored;
nevertheless there was a keenness about him
that was unmistakable.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had expected to hear from you,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;The understanding was, if I remember
correctly, that you were to come to me immediately
upon my grandfather&#8217;s death.&#8221; He
looked inquiringly at the adventurer. &#8220;But,
perhaps,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you had reasons for
not doing so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good reasons,&#8221; replied Kenyon, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I waited patiently; but when I learned
from Miss Gilbert that the old man was dead,
and still you did not put in an appearance, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
could wait no longer. I got into town this
afternoon, and called up about all the hotels
in New York, inquiring if they had anyone of
your name. I got to this one about a half
hour ago, and so I came immediately upon
learning you were here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you did so,&#8221; replied the other.
Then as an afterthought, &#8220;Have you seen
Miss Gilbert to-day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen Miss Gilbert.&#8221; Austin
ran his fingers through his sandy hair. &#8220;In
fact I never knew that there was a Miss Gilbert
until the other day.&#8221; He looked at Kenyon
speculatively for a moment, and then
continued. &#8220;Do you know that you have her
puzzled, more or less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least I so gathered from her letter.
She seems to be not at all sure of you. She
told me that she desired to believe you a
friend to me, but that she could not honestly
assure me that you were. She feared that
you were leagued with the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon nodded, coolly; but he was amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible,&#8221; he mentally exclaimed,
&#8220;that I have here the mysterious unknown!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But look here,&#8221; said the young man, &#8220;I
think this whole situation is really farcical.
There is no common sense to it. You see, because
I&#8217;ve always been messing among inventions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
and things of that sort, my grandfather
got the notion that I was far from practical,
and actually not qualified to take care of
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old men have rather odd fancies at
times,&#8221; said Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so. And he would not listen to any
of my protestations; he ordered me under
cover until you had come along and pronounced
everything safe. The whole thing
was absurd; but what was I to do? Even
now I&#8217;m going against his wishes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it would seem,&#8221; agreed Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea of these partners of his being
such formidable and ruthless persons, got to
be a sort of obsession with him,&#8221; proceeded
Philip Austin. &#8220;Why, he feared them, as
far as I was concerned, as he had never feared
anything before. You see,&#8221; lowering his
voice and leaning toward Kenyon, confidentially,
&#8220;he had the notion that they wanted
my cousin, Scott Austin, to inherit the control
of the business, in order that the contraband
end of it should continue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, this branch of the business of
Austin &amp; Co. was largely carried on by Farbush,
at New York, and Hong Yo, at Hong
Kong. I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; and the young man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
looked at Kenyon, appealingly, &#8220;that my
grandfather ever profited a dollar by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When it became known that the old man
was about to die&mdash;that he could not live above
a few months at most, he sent a young man,
a minor partner, Forrester by name, to acquaint
me with many things which he felt that
I should know&mdash;he meaning that I should be
his heir. I remember very distinctly expressing
myself plainly as to the illegal features of
the business of Austin &amp; Co. If I should
ever come into control, I promised to smash
the contraband end as flat as a board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Forrester told the other partners at
Hong Kong and New York?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have. At any rate they both
appeared at Seattle; and what they said and
did must have frightened my grandfather
thoroughly. It was then that he ordered me
to lay low until you came along to take charge
of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why I, in particular?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His first thought was to secure the services
of General Nunez. But he learned that
Nunez was dead. It seems that he had heard
much of you through Nunez; and, rather
naturally, you were the next person considered.&#8221;</p>

<p>That the young man was speaking the plain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
truth Kenyon never questioned for a moment;
he saw that the time had arrived to make
some sort of a finish to the case, and that to
have a free and frank understanding would
perhaps serve him better than anything else.
So, beginning with his coming upon the <i>Blenheim</i>,
he related his adventures since arriving
in New York. Philip Austin listened as Webster
had listened, in astonishment, and silence.
When he had heard all, he remarked,
slowly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, that is all very wonderful?
I now begin also to get an idea of what Miss
Gilbert hinted at in her letter.&#8221; He looked
at Kenyon, curiously, and then laughed.
&#8220;Things do turn out strangely, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Undoubtedly,&#8221; Kenyon answered. Then
with a change of tone: &#8220;Who is Miss Gilbert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered the other
frankly. &#8220;You see I had little or no knowledge
of my grandfather&#8217;s household. I
never visited there; we did not even correspond,
for he always fancied that I was
next door to a fool for not giving up my experimenting
in chemicals and mechanics and
settling down to practical business. But,&#8221;
and young Austin wrinkled his brow, &#8220;it
seems to me that I did hear something about
his adopting the daughters of an old friend,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
years ago, when I was quite a youngster.
However,&#8221; and he nodded his head confidently,
&#8220;whoever she is, she must be all right;
for the old man seems to have trusted her in
everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon had passed the other his cigarette-case;
and now they smoked silently for some
time. Finally the sandy-haired young man
spoke, and his voice was grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, what you have said has astounded
me! All along I have been holding
this thing lightly, as a sort of hallucination
which a man desperately ill is likely to be
seized with. I could not seriously consider
that, at this late day, any such ornate scheme
of murder would be undertaken by the settled
and prosperous members of a great business
enterprise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One can never tell,&#8221; replied Kenyon.
&#8220;The crooked element in the business of Austin
&amp; Co. may have proven so very profitable
that Hong Yo and Farbush would rather risk
their necks than give it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Kenyon, rising. He
took down the receiver and called. &#8220;Hello!
Who is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kenyon of Saginaw wants the other Kenyon,&#8221;
answered a voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here he is. But how&#8217;s the head?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>&#8220;Fine and fancy. I&#8217;m still under wraps,
but it&#8217;s only to make sure. I really don&#8217;t
need &#8217;em. It felt so good to-day, that I went
out hunting that guy, the &#8216;Stalker.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In a minute! You see I had picked up a
fellow that knew him, and he pointed him out
to me. Well, I wasn&#8217;t taking any chances of
mixing it with him; I wasn&#8217;t just ready for
<i>that</i> yet. So I followed the plug around to
see where he was stabling. I wanted to be
able to pick him up any time I wanted him,
you see. And after a while he gets so funny
in his actions that I felt sure that he had
something on. You know, you told me that
if I could dig up any more news about this
Selden&#8217;s Square thing, to do it; and it struck
me that I was just ripe to find something out
if I stalked the &#8216;Stalker.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And did you?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did. You see, when&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a moment. Come over to the hotel.
I&#8217;ll leave word at the office to have them send
you right up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, bo, I&#8217;ll be there in ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon then called the office, after which
he hung up and turned to Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;We will possibly have some news of consequence
in a little while,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; returned the other, &#8220;as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
thing stands it&#8217;s rather unsatisfactory. This
little matter of Forrester is really aggravating.&#8221;</p>

<p>Promptly at the expiration of ten minutes,
the pugilist from Saginaw was shown in. He
seemed all eagerness, and at Kenyon&#8217;s invitation
immediately began his story.</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as I falls to it that I&#8217;m due for
some information, why, I begins to play the
fox myself, see? So the more this Stalker
throws his gaze around, the hotter I&#8217;m on the
Sherlock thing. After getting a lot of stuff
together at different places, he hikes out and
gets a train for South Norwalk. But he can&#8217;t
shake me, so I&#8217;m about three seats behind him
all the way down. Once or twice I notices
him piking me off. It&#8217;s the bandages on my
top that does it; he&#8217;s sure that he&#8217;s seen them
before and is trying to locate them. But I
keep the innocent look, and have my nose
pointed into a magazine; it&#8217;s a plain thing to
me that I&#8217;ve got him guessing.</p>

<p>&#8220;He gets out at South Norwalk. I pike
him on the platform waiting to see if I follow
him. But I have the wisdom with me, and
make my duck on the other side. He waits
awhile; but as I&#8217;m not to be seen he starts
straight off. He gets a buggy and I get another.
About five miles outside the town he
meets another party, quite a big stuff, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
has another buggy, and hands over the things
that he&#8217;s brought along. They talk for some
time, and then his Stalkers turns his horse
and starts back. I&#8217;m pulled off the road into
a kind of wagon track, all this time, you see,
so he drives by and goes on his way to the
station, while I pull out and starts to follow
up the other party.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Excellent!&#8221; praised Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was only a chance,&#8221; continued the
other. &#8220;I thought it might have something
to do with the affair you were asking me
about, you see. Well, at last the big guy
comes to kind of a fine-looking old house
standing away back in a little woods, and
there he meets a girl with yellow hair that
seems mighty glad to see him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon and Austin exchanged looks, but
the other continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;They went inside and I lingered around
for a while to see if there would be anything
doing; but as all was quiet along that section
of the pike, I drove along a little farther until
I sights a young heck cutting wood. In a
minute I was framed up against him, handing
him the wise talk; and he told me all he knew&mdash;that
is, all of it that I wanted to hear. The
people at the old house in the woods had only
come last night. As far as he knew a man
and a woman arrived then&mdash;late. But this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
morning about a dozen men landed. He had
no idea what was up; but he had a kind of
hunch that it wasn&#8217;t quite level. So after
that I got back to the station and caught a
train for New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Forrester and the girl Anna,&#8221; said
Austin, promptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely.&#8221; Kenyon picked up a time-table
and began studying it. &#8220;I rather think
I&#8217;ll pay them a visit to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good,&#8221; cried the other. &#8220;And shall I go
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to have you.&#8221; Kenyon then went
to the &#8217;phone and called up Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it,&#8221; answered the young man
from Chicago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Another adventure. Are you game for
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only try me,&#8221; came the eager reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, I&#8217;ll pick you up on the way
to the station.&#8221;</p>

<p>The motor-car which Kenyon ordered was
announced, and he and Austin had drawn on
their overcoats when the little pugilist said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I say, if you think you could use a guy of
my tonnage, pal, why, just give the word.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think of trying to do without
you,&#8221; replied Kenyon. &#8220;Come along.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE LIGHT GROWS STRONGER</small></h2>



<p class="center">&#8220;The plans of men have various terminations.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>The Strategy of Nunez.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little party left the train at South
Norwalk; it was shortly after nine o&#8217;clock
when they engaged a carry-all from a liveryman
and began the journey along the road
which the youth from Saginaw indicated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather a dark night,&#8221; commented Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like ink,&#8221; replied Philip Austin.</p>

<p>A lamp hung at each side of the trap, and
they projected their struggling rays for a
very short space ahead; the horses, with ears
cocked, jogged briskly along. The road, when
they had left the town well behind, grew
lonely and still.</p>

<p>The lines of rail fencing went wavering by
in the lamp-light; trees by the wayside
seemed vast and shadowy and full of strange
murmurings; now and then, from far across
the fields, they caught the flicker of a light
in a farmhouse.</p>

<p>At length after they had been on the road
about a half hour or more, they heard a faint
whistle.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>&#8220;This is the place where the Stalker met
the other party,&#8221; whispered the pugilist. &#8220;I
can tell it by the cross-roads.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon drew in the horses, and a man
emerged from the shadows. He peered into
the vehicle and seemed disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I thought you
were some friends of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of a lonely place to wait, isn&#8217;t it,&#8221;
asked Kenyon, examining the man keenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not very lively,&#8221; returned he, rather
surlily. &#8220;Going on to Cranberry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond that,&#8221; answered Kenyon. He
was about to drive on when the man suddenly
placed his hand upon the shaft, as though
struck by a thought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say,&#8221; said he, &#8220;did you have anybody
walking ahead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man ignored the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see anyone on the road as you
came along?&#8221; continued he.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s damned funny!&#8221; muttered the fellow,
and with that he turned away and was lost in
the darkness.</p>

<p>Kenyon touched the horses with the whip;
a little further on he remarked: &#8220;That would
appear to be one of the men who arrived this
morning, eh?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>&#8220;It must be,&#8221; answered Webster. &#8220;And
apparently he&#8217;s posted at the cross-roads as
a sort of lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it strike you that he seemed a little
bewildered?&#8221; asked Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s &#8216;seeing things at night,&#8217;&#8221; put in the
pugilist. &#8220;And when a guy begins to do that
in a nice, dark, lonely place, it kind of gets
him going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone probably passed along the road,
and paid no attention to his signal, if he
gave one,&#8221; suggested Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Um-m-m!&#8221; grunted Webster. And as
they proceeded slowly along he narrowly
scanned the roadside; also he listened attentively
for any sounds that the night might
hold, beyond his line of vision.</p>

<p>After a time the youth from Saginaw said:</p>

<p>&#8220;See that bunch of deeper black over
there? Well, I&#8217;m pretty sure them&#8217;s the
trees that I told you about. The house stands
right in the thick of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dense black mass loomed against the sky
to the right; and as they looked they caught
the glimmer of light through it. Kenyon was
about to pull up the horses when a second
whistle fell upon their ears; so, instead, he
shook the reins and went jogging on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Apparently Mr. Forrester is a most cautious
person,&#8221; said he, in a low tone. &#8220;He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
seems to have the place as thickly picketed as
the camp of a flying column. I wonder why.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He fears visitors, perhaps,&#8221; suggested
Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why does he remain so close to the
city? Why did he not put a long distance between
himself and pursuit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Depend upon it,&#8221; put in Austin, confidently,
&#8220;he has some excellent reason. And
I feel that we are to have it made plain to us
before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some little distance further along they took
down a section of fence, drove into a field and
unhitched. After tying the horses securely
they made their way softly back across the
fields in the direction of the gloomy grove
where they had seen the twinkling light. The
earth was hard with early frost. Here and
there the thin ice, that had formed upon some
shallow pools, crackled under their feet; there
were fences to climb, and once they came upon
a small creek which had to be waded with
some discomfort. But finally they arrived at
the edge of the grove.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; commented Kenyon, as they
paused for a moment among the trees, &#8220;he
doesn&#8217;t seem to have safeguarded all the approaches,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Softly they advanced toward the house. In
places the earth was littered with fallen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
leaves which were dry and would have made
a great crackling under the feet of four men;
but by instinct, it seemed, Kenyon led them
along the wind-swept spaces, soundless and
like shadows.</p>

<p>The house stood in a narrow clearing. Several
of the lower windows were brilliantly
lighted and threw bars of radiance across the
lawn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has quite a colonial look,&#8221; said Webster.
&#8220;Witness the high, narrow windows,
the small lights of glass, the many stone steps,
and the tremendous main door.&#8221;</p>

<p>Austin suddenly clutched Kenyon by the
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there!&#8221; he breathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; in the same low tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the window, to the right. It was a
woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got a little glimpse of her,&#8221; said
Saginaw. &#8220;And, say, she looked as if she
was tip-toeing around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was my impression, too,&#8221; replied
Austin, wonderingly. &#8220;Every movement
seemed caution itself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A servant, perhaps,&#8221; suggested Webster.</p>

<p>They remained in the shadow of the trees
for some little time watching the window indicated;
but the woman did not reappear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to get nearer the house,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
said Kenyon. &#8220;But it&#8217;s rather a ticklish proceeding
to cross those shafts of light; for
there is really no knowing how many of those
dozen men may be lying about in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the windows at the rear are not
lighted,&#8221; suggested Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! I&#8217;ll work my way around there
and see. It will perhaps be best for the rest
of you to remain where you are. Don&#8217;t break
cover until you hear me call or are sure that
I&#8217;ve gotten into trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with this he crept softly away into the
darkness. While in the front of the house
he kept to the trees; but when he reached the
side where the light did not fall he ventured
into the clearing, as the progress was less
difficult there.</p>

<p>He had not taken a dozen steps when a
heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder; and a
rough voice said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I heard somebody out there!
So, now then, neighbor, give an account&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He only reached this far when Kenyon&#8217;s
arm shot around with a sort of hooking motion.
The blow traveled no more than five
inches, yet the man dropped as though he had
been shot. Kenyon bent over him for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;He seems good for a half hour,&#8221; he muttered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll have to risk his coming to
and giving an alarm.&#8221;</p>

<p>He wasted no time over the fallen man, but
continued on his way. When he gained the
rear of the house he found that all was darkness.
But he heard the constant murmur of
voices from somewhere near at hand, and so
did not dare to advance farther. At length,
however, a door opened, and a man stepped
out bearing a lantern. In the rays of this
Kenyon saw two men seated upon an old-fashioned
settle near the door; it was these
whose voices he had heard.</p>

<p>The man with the lantern stood in the doorway
for a moment; behind him Kenyon
caught a glimpse of a dimly lighted hall of
great width that seemed to run directly
through the building. The three exchanged
some remarks which Kenyon could not catch;
the two men upon the settle arose, and the
third closed the door. Then they struck into
a narrow path among the trees and disappeared.
Kenyon waited until the sounds of
their footsteps had died away; then he advanced
boldly, opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>No one was to be seen; the lights were dim,
as he had noticed from the outside. Softly
but deliberately he walked down the length of
the wide hall and turned into a room where a
bright light was burning. But the room, also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
was empty, and he paused, looking about him.
There was a doorway hung with heavy porti&egrave;res,
leading to a room beyond, and as
Kenyon stood examining the place the voice
of Forrester reached him from this latter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, my dear, it is all for the best.
You shall see that before the night is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, Griscom,&#8221; said the voice of
Anna. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t help being nervous.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course not; and to tell you the honest
truth, I am also a bit that way. It&#8217;s the
suspense that does it.&#8221; There was a short
pause, during which Kenyon heard the rustling
of papers; then Forrester proceeded:
&#8220;I don&#8217;t fear Hong Yo in the least; and as
for Farbush, well, you know how I classed
him long ago. It&#8217;s the other&mdash;that close
mouthed, swift-eyed Kenyon that I really
dread.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I,&#8221; echoed Anna. &#8220;He is so secretive,
he seems to know so much that we
thought no one knew; and he is so cold and
observing; he appears to be weighing one&#8217;s
thoughts, continually, and casting about for
some means of profiting by the result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been some sort of an evil
influence that prompted me to encourage
the old man in his desire to have this same
fellow,&#8221; said Forrester, and there was a note<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
of complaint in his voice that made Kenyon
smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never could understand what made you
do it,&#8221; said the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought it for the best. Like fools, Farbush
and Hong began making threats as to
what they would do if young Philip Austin
succeeded to the business. The old man became
frightened. One day he told me that
he intended to send for a man who he knew
could be trusted to protect Philip.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that man was Kenyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. God knows where old Stephen had
ever heard of him. And I had to encourage
this notion, or perhaps have him invoke the
law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The last would never have done,&#8221; said the
girl, hastily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. I saw at once that the
only safe thing to do was to find the man,
somehow, and arrange matters with him, if
he was willing to make a deal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the result of your efforts was those
three foolish persons who wandered into the
net like so many stupid flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon heard a fist strike a table impatiently;
then Forrester cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive myself for that blunder!
It was caused by over-anxiety. I desired to
gain time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>&#8220;But to write four letters; to direct them
to different places! Was that not taking a
desperate chance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something had to be done. I could think
of nothing better. Old Stephen did not know
where Kenyon was at that time, but he was
trying to trace him. I found, in his desk, a
list of four places where the person sought
<i>had</i> been, and then conceived the plan of writing
a letter to each of these places, in the hope
that one or the other of them would reach him
in some way. I named the house in Selden&#8217;s
Square as the place&mdash;Farbush taking it
blindly at my request&mdash;and the night upon
which old Stephen died as the time of meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;All this was meant to save time. The
idea was sound, and the whole trouble resulted
from the old man&#8217;s not knowing Kenyon&#8217;s
first name. So I was forced to address
the letters simply to <i>Mr.</i> Kenyon. And the
cursed post-office delivered three of them to
strangers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Griscom! Griscom! It was not all ill-luck.
You were foolish, indiscreet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I fancied the man who wrote me from
Butte was the right person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were you sure? Was there anything to
warrant your doing what you did. You at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
once told him everything. He might have
ruined all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, have you, too, turned
against me! Farbush has gibed at me for the
past week for that mistake, and though Hong
says little, I know he holds it over my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Kenyon heard a sudden rustling of
skirts, an ejaculation; a succession of kisses
and a smothered flood of endearments.
Finally Anna&#8217;s voice was heard, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;But let them plot and struggle! What do
we care? We have what we want&mdash;what we
have always wanted. It does not make any
difference to us who succeeds to Stephen
Austin&#8217;s business, now.&#8221; There was a great
rustling of paper, as though someone had
plunged eager hands among a heap of loose
sheets. &#8220;Five hundred thousand dollars!&#8221;
came the girl&#8217;s voice, high and triumphant.
&#8220;A half million of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not money, my dear, but something just
as serviceable. Negotiable securities. How
fortunate you heard old Stephen trying to tell
Dallas where they were that day while he
lay dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not dream that she understood. I
almost died upon the night I met that man
upon the stairs, for then I understood that
she had told him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, woman&#8217;s intuition!&#8221; cried Forrester<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
in delight, while Kenyon&#8217;s shoulders shook
sardonically. &#8220;And so when we found the
safe opened and the securities gone, you knew
the very place to look for them.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both laughed at this; then there were
more endearments.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be interesting and perhaps somewhat
profitable,&#8221; mused Kenyon, as he patiently
waited, &#8220;to know just how little acuteness
and how much chance there is mingled
with the majority of successful moves. I
think I&#8217;d back the latter to win.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But in spite of all our good luck,&#8221; said
Anna, after a time, &#8220;I cannot help dreading
the coming of Hong Yo and Mr. Farbush.
Oh, my dear, why did we not continue on. We
could have left the country, and they would
never have known where we had gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But think of the continuous suspense that
we should have been in; we should forever be
fearing pursuit. No, no; trust me! The way
I have selected is the best. They can do us no
harm.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm? They may murder you! You
know what they are. And you cannot even
defend yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have <i>others</i> engaged who can defend
me.&#8221; Forrester laughed, but Kenyon
noted that it was forced and husky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this birth-curse,&#8221; the man proceeded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
a species of despair now in his voice. &#8220;The
mere thought of blood makes me smother with
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; was the listening adventurer&#8217;s
silent comment. &#8220;The blood-horror was not
a bluff, after all. What a peculiar situation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently it was fully appreciated by the
two in the adjoining room. The girl softly
murmured her sympathy, and the man said, in
a lowered tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curse that I&#8217;ve carried through life
like an incubus. A thousand times has it held
me back when I&#8217;ve had victories in my very
hands. Look at the case with old Stephen.
Hong did not trust me. He made me plead
my disability in order that the old man should
not tell me too much, and so give me an advantage
over himself and Farbush! Oh, if I
could only shake it off! If I could only rid
myself of it for good!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was still comforting him when
there came the steady tramp of footsteps
upon the hard ground without and the sound
of voices.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have come!&#8221; Kenyon heard the girl
exclaim, and there was terror in her tones.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be brave!&#8221; Forrester whispered, as the
great hall door opened, and a gust of cold air
swept through the passage and into the rooms
in a way that made the lights dance. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
footsteps were heard in the hall&mdash;slow, painful
footsteps&mdash;and the door closed with a
bang. Kenyon peered through the porti&egrave;res
to get a view of the newcomers. He saw Forrester
and Anna standing beside a table in
the centre of the room. In a doorway stood
Farbush, his face white and ominous with
rage; and leaning upon him was Hong Yo,
looking like the spectre of death itself, but
gazing at the young man and girl with laughing
mockery in his slit-like eyes.</p>

<small>WHAT KENYON HEARD AND SAW</small></h2>


<p class="center">&#8220;The end, when it comes, comes quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="illoright">&mdash;<i>An Adage of Hong Yo.</i></span></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment there was silence, then, as
Kenyon watched, he saw long, shuddering
spasms of laughter shake the emaciated
frame of Hong Yo, while one yellow claw was
weakly raised, pointing in ghoulish mirth at
Forrester.</p>

<p>Kenyon felt his skin prickle.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a hideous beast!&#8221; he muttered, his
face showing his repugnance. &#8220;If it were
possible to see his soul, I wonder what it
would look like?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were longing for our society, were
you?&#8221; spoke Hong Yo, in his slow, careful
English. &#8220;And we had all but given you up.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was racked by a fit of coughing; Farbush
led him to a chair, and when the paroxysm
had subsided, he was breathless and
almost without life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you sit down?&#8221; Forrester said to
Farbush.</p>

<p>The latter did so, silently. He sat far back
in the chair, drumming with noiseless fingers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
upon its arms, his hard eyes full of fury, his
thin, cruel mouth shut in a straight line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our friend Hong is to be the speaker,
however,&#8221; concluded Kenyon, from his vantage
behind the porti&egrave;res. &#8220;That seems to be
understood between them.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a few moments the Chinaman had recovered
somewhat, but when he spoke it was
in a faint, gasping wheeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a pretty ruse&mdash;that of the
yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forrester stared at the speaker in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;The yacht?&#8221; said he inquiringly.</p>

<p>A ghastly grin crossed Hong Yo&#8217;s face; he
waved a hand in a feeble gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;We met her before she had passed North
Brother Island. We expected to find you on
board&mdash;and these,&#8221; pointing to the securities
upon the table.</p>

<p>Forrester laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible that <i>you</i> went in chase of the
<i>Wizard</i>? Why, that little matter was laid
down for the astute Mr. Kenyon&#8217;s private
use.&#8221;</p>

<p>The watcher saw Farbush start.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kenyon!&#8221; exclaimed the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, to be sure. I was confident that,
with his infernal cleverness, he&#8217;d think of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
yacht when he found that Anna had gotten
the securities.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! So you admit the cracking of the
safe now?&#8221; Farbush leaned toward the
younger man, and his thin lips curled back
from his teeth. &#8220;You denied it strongly
enough upon the night that it was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I still deny it,&#8221; answered Forrester. He
seated himself beside the table and began
gathering up the securities. &#8220;In fact I don&#8217;t
mind admitting that such a neat and effective
job is entirely beyond me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo and Farbush exchanged glances.</p>

<p>&#8220;The securities were locked in the safe,&#8221;
said Hong Yo. &#8220;And you admit that Anna
took them; then she&mdash;or you&mdash;must have
forced the safe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conclusion is natural enough,&#8221; replied
Forrester, &#8220;but is scarcely correct.
Anna did get the securities, as I said, but not
from your safe,&#8221; to Farbush.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the girl, &#8220;from Dallas Gilbert.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men started, but said nothing;
Forrester smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will be astonished to hear, I feel sure,
that Dallas and Kenyon have established a
sort of co-partnership in this matter of ours.
He was on the premises upon the night the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
safe was opened; in fact, I&#8217;m quite convinced
that it was he that did the opening.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence; then Hong
Yo said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday you would have surprised us
with this; but not now. We were quite convinced,
last night, that Kenyon, like yourself,
is playing a game of his own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And we may astonish <i>you</i> some,&#8221; spoke
Farbush, &#8220;by telling you that not only is he
leagued with Dallas Gilbert, but with young
Philip Austin, as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forrester stared; Anna clasped her hands,
nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Austin with Kenyon last night,&#8221;
said Farbush, &#8220;as plainly as I see you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Forrester and Anna were visibly
amazed; but not any more than was Kenyon
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a point that I missed, somehow,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;Either that, or it&#8217;s some sort
of a blind to fool Forrester.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But all this has no real connection with
our visit,&#8221; said Hong Yo, hollowly. &#8220;The
Stalker said that you had a matter of importance
to settle with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; replied Forrester. He placed
his hand upon the packet of securities. &#8220;It
is about these.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo coughed. The almost fleshless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
hand trembled as he lifted it to his lips; then
he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagined that. But go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to withdraw from the arrangement
that we made. I am not fitted to carry it out.
As you are aware, I cannot go far enough.
This booty is to be my share; the remainder I
leave for you and Farbush.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The burning little eyes shone through the
puckered, slanting lids; the bloodless lips
smiled. It was like the horrid mirth of a
demon in a medi&aelig;val poem.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that our plans seem apt to go
astray,&#8221; mocked he, &#8220;you have thought it
well to feather your own nest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I offered all along to do this very thing,&#8221;
cried Forrester. &#8220;I knew when murder was
seriously entertained, that I must withdraw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo arose. His step was wavering
and strengthless; there seemed to be only a
flutter of life in his shrunken frame; but, to
the watching Kenyon, his purpose was as
deadly as the look in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You persist in this?&#8221; asked he, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Forrester, quietly.</p>

<p>Farbush sat with one leg crossed over the
other; his face had suddenly grown expressionless,
his body seemed tensely flexed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>&#8220;He expects a climax, I fancy,&#8221; thought
Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did it never occur to you,&#8221; gasped Hong
Yo, steadying himself by laying his left hand
upon the back of a chair, &#8220;that we might not
be willing to fall in with your views.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forrester smiled, confidently. The fresh,
boyish candor which had so struck Kenyon, at
first sight of him, was perfect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think you will,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see how you can very well refuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hong Yo had drawn nearer, and Kenyon
noted the yellow claw once more stealing
toward the breast of his blouse. But Forrester
did not give way; he only smiled,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;you are hardly
in a position to refuse me. I have dropped
my connection with your plot for good and
all. With these securities I disappear never
to be heard of again. Without them, I remain
in New York to tell what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the last word left his lips, the knife of
the Chinaman flashed in the lamp-light. Anna
screamed; but for a moment Forrester retained
his calmness.</p>

<p>&#8220;He expects help,&#8221; was the thought that
flashed through Kenyon&#8217;s mind.</p>

<p>But the help for some reason did not come;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
and then the confidence suddenly died, leaving
the young giant white and apparently paralyzed
with fear. Hong Yo was taking the step
that would bring him within striking distance;
and like a fascinated thing Forrester awaited
the blow. Again Anna screamed; and now
she threw herself upon Forrester&#8217;s breast.
The knife was raised and would have fallen,
but there came a sharp, answering cry, the
sound of swift-moving feet, and two strong
white hands clutched the arm of Hong Yo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dallas!&#8221; cried Kenyon in amazement;
and with the name upon his lips, he whipped
out his long revolver, thrust aside the porti&egrave;res,
and stepped into the room.</p>

<p>Farbush had leaped to his feet, but with
what intention will never be known; for at
sight of Kenyon and the murderous Colt he
shrank back. Dallas uttered a little cry of
joy; she sprang to meet Kenyon with outstretched
hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I am still trying
to furnish proof of my rectitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>He pressed her hand as he spoke, and his
brown eyes twinkled humorously; but, at the
same time, they never left Hong Yo and Farbush,
and the black muzzle of his huge weapon
was not once lowered.</p>

<p>Then the adventurer swiftly stepped to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>
table and laid a hand upon the packet of
securities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; said he, coolly, &#8220;that I will take
charge of these, just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He slid them into his overcoat pocket, and
then glanced sharply around as he caught a
queer sound from Hong Yo. The Chinaman
was swaying weakly; his hands vaguely
clutched at the empty air, and his pale lips
were muttering in his own language. Then
suddenly he pitched forward and lay still.
Farbush crept forward, cowed, to look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dead,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>And just then, through the doorway, came
Philip Austin, Garry Webster, and the bandaged
youth from Saginaw.</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard the screams,&#8221; said Webster,
&#8220;and thought you might need us.&#8221; Then
seeing the stark form of Hong Yo, he exclaimed:
&#8220;Hello! What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks quite a bit like the end to me,&#8221;
replied Kenyon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Garry Webster</span> and Philip Austin were at
dinner in the former&#8217;s apartments some few
nights later, when Kenyon was announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have a bite, old boy,&#8221; Webster incited.
&#8220;We have some little things here that I know
you&#8217;ll appreciate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, no; I&#8217;ve only stopped in to keep
you from bothering me upon that confounded
telephone of yours. I&#8217;ve not had a restful
moment at my apartments for days. I&#8217;ve
either been forced to listen to your frantic
calls, or been in constant expectation of their
renewal, every moment of the time I&#8217;ve been

<p>Webster grinned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, you know,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it&#8217;s nothing

know any little thing you&#8217;d found out.&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had put down his hat, overcoat,
gloves, and stick, Kenyon turned his back to
Webster&#8217;s ruddy log fire and looked comfortable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>&#8220;Look what it is to have money,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;Log fires; nice little dinners; expensive
hotels. The hardware trade must be an excellent
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No better than the importing of fine oriental
stuffs,&#8221; replied Webster, calmly, as he
went on with his dinner. &#8220;Austin has just
been telling me about his offer to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I renew it,&#8221; spoke Austin seriously.
&#8220;Since I&#8217;ve kicked out Farbush and that fellow
Forrester, and since Hong Yo is dead,
I&#8217;ve got the entire thing to myself. I&#8217;ll have
you in as a partner, if you&#8217;ll run the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take you up,&#8221; said Kenyon,
quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bravo!&#8221; Young Austin arose and solemnly
shook the adventurer&#8217;s hand. &#8220;Do you
know, the sudden shifting of all this upon my
shoulders has sort of upset me. I&#8217;ve got
work to do at my laboratories in Chicago, and
will have no time to fool away on a shipping
trade at Seattle. Another thing: I have no
taste for the thing, and could never grasp its
details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Kenyon is just the fellow for it,&#8221; put
in Webster. &#8220;He knows more about China
than most people; and then he&#8217;s a regular
bull-terrier for holding on. I always said
he&#8217;d make an excellent business man.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; smiled Kenyon, &#8220;your friendly
offices, Garry, are very grateful. And they
are much more kindly meant than those of my
old co-laborer, Balmacenso.&#8221;</p>

<p>Webster lifted his brows.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve learned something against that
worthy revolutionist, then,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; among the securities and other
papers which I took from Forrester and
turned over to Austin were a few letters
which I took the liberty of withholding. They
were addressed to Forrester and signed with
my name&mdash;but they were in the handwriting
of Balmacenso.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The blackguard!&#8221; exclaimed Austin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t he! It was a neat, carefully laid
little plan. From certain angles I have nothing
but admiration for it. You see, he opened
Forrester&#8217;s first letter to me at Rio. I know
he did it in the hope that it contained money,
for I remember telling him one day that if
things did not get better for us, I&#8217;d have to
send North for a loan. And I had you in
mind,&#8221; bowing to Webster, with much ceremony.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have been most happy,&#8221; returned
that gentleman, solemnly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forrester&#8217;s offer must have struck Balmacenso&#8217;s
fancy. At any rate he answered
it, signing my name. Then came other letters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span>
carrying the matter farther along, including a
number from your grandfather,&#8221; to Austin.
&#8220;Balmacenso must have known that the <i>Blenheim</i>
was due at Rio at a certain time, and
wrote that he would sail in her. He always
used my name, and not once did I get even
so much as a breath of any side of the affair.
And in his planning he was rather complete,
too. He arranged for the place of meeting
and the signal by which he was to be known.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that was?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The slapping of a folded newspaper upon
the palm of his hand. The latter was scarcely
original. It sounds like a &#8216;personal&#8217; from
the <i>Herald</i>. Perhaps proximity had something
to do with it. Then there was a photo
of Balmacenso that had been sent. Dallas
fancied I looked like it. So when I, of all
persons, happened to appear at the time and
place specified, and unconsciously to give the
signal, she could not doubt but that I was the
man she was waiting for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It sounds like something that might have
happened to one of the Barber&#8217;s Seven
Brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it? But fever was a thing that
Balmacenso had not counted on; he had been
dead some little time when the <i>Blenheim</i>
entered Rio harbor; and instead of <i>his</i> sailing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
on her, <i>I</i> suddenly made up my mind to do
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so fell into the situation that was to
have been his,&#8221; said Webster. &#8220;It&#8217;s plain
enough now, old boy. Balmacenso would
have grasped right bravely all the things that
puzzled you so, that night in Selden&#8217;s Square.
No doubt but that old Mr. Austin had sent
him all the information which the conspirators
supposed you to have had. If, now, you
only had come upon the rascal&#8217;s papers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did make a search among his effects,
thinking to get track of some relatives to
whom I could send the news of his death. But
there was not a scrap of writing to be found.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had been at pains to secrete carefully
anything of the kind, I suppose,&#8221; remarked
Austin. &#8220;The villain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, he had been a very decent sort all
along,&#8221; said Kenyon, beginning to resume his
things. &#8220;It was being moneyless in a strange
country that broke his nerve and drove him to
rascality, like as not. There are types of
men who cannot bear up under poverty, you
know.&#8221; He drew on his gloves and took up
his stick and hat. &#8220;At any rate, I prefer to
look at it so, for as I told you some time ago,
Garry, he once saved my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood with his hand upon the door-knob,
about to go, nodding over his shoulder at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
two at the table. Then a sudden smile
crossed his face, and he turned once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;That reminds me,&#8221; said he. &#8220;You know
that we were all rather puzzled by the statement
of Farbush&#8217;s made the other night, that
he had seen us together,&#8221; to Austin, &#8220;on the
night of the adventure on the East River.
Well, a chance remark of Anna&#8217;s to-day shed
some light upon that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us have it,&#8221; pleaded Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that Anna once had a glimpse of
you in &#8217;Frisco,&#8221; continued Kenyon to Austin.
&#8220;She was walking with Forrester when you
went by in a motor-car; and he pointed you
out.&#8221; Then the speaker turned to Webster.
&#8220;Do you recall the night that we dined downstairs&mdash;the
night that Farbush first appeared?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the girl in the heavy veil was Anna.
And she mistook you for Austin. She had
had only one glimpse of you,&#8221; to Austin.
&#8220;And I suppose the only impression left by
it was that you were rather short, somewhat
stout and had reddish hair. Well, if you&#8217;ll
notice it, Webster has the same general characteristics;
and what more natural mistake
could she make when she saw him with me at
such a stage in the proceedings? So she told
Farbush that Webster was Austin.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>&#8220;But about the night upon the river?&#8221; demanded
Webster, perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very simple. When the searchlight
from the fort swept the deck of the Vixen, you
were plainly in sight. Farbush saw you; but
I thought at the time that it was Miss Gilbert
whom he had recognized.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Life in large cities is a peculiar thing,&#8221;
mused Webster, sotto voce, and in an exaggerated
attitude of melodrama. &#8220;It is,
really!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Farbush&#8217;s hurried note to you that
evening below, congratulating you upon your
celerity and warning you against overboldness,
was all upon the strength of your supposed
rapid finding of me,&#8221; laughed Austin.
&#8220;Well, well! That was a curious turn
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned anything as to why old
Mr. Austin&#8217;s body was removed secretly, in
the night, from the house in Selden&#8217;s
Square?&#8221; asked Webster. &#8220;I could never
understand that move, among others.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did not desire, so Farbush has told
me, to have Austin, here, know of his grandfather&#8217;s
death until they could so manipulate
the matter of the securities, and some other
things connected with the business, that even
if his life were spared in the end, he would
never suspect any tampering with the accounts.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
Toward the last, the correspondence
having been interrupted, they had about given
up hope of my arrival, and so they planned
delays, until I should get upon the ground.
These plans were under way when I arrived;
and so, I suppose, they did not think it worth
while to alter them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When they had your three namesakes
assaulted that night in Selden&#8217;s Square,&#8221;
said Austin, &#8220;I think the conspirators took a
great risk of betraying themselves to the
police. I can&#8217;t see why the thing was necessary.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget that the man from Butte knew
their game. He got his information from a
second letter, written in reply to one from
him before they heard from Balmacenso.
After Balmacenso&#8217;s letter was received, they
felt sure that <i>he</i> was the man they were looking
for, and they realized that the Butte man
was dangerous and must be removed. It is
more than likely that the other two had never
written, but just came on at the time appointed.
We know this to be the case with
Saginaw. His letter only reached him thirty-six
hours ahead. So three men came to Selden&#8217;s
Square instead of one; and as the plotters
did not know which of them was the man
from Butte, they did for all three, to make
sure.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>&#8220;What do you suppose was to be your part
in their game,&#8221; asked Webster.</p>

<p>&#8220;That of a traitor, almost entirely. I was
thought to be stuffed to the neck with information
that would throw the matter directly
into their hands, when I was ready to
act; all the secrets of old Stephen Austin
were believed to be at my finger ends, you see.
Of course, they knew that Forrester possessed
the old man&#8217;s confidence; but they
knew that it was only in a limited degree, and
that it would be worth little unless coupled
with what I was supposed to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Kenyon left the Waldorf-Astoria he
walked up Fifth Avenue some little distance,
and then crossed to Madison. In a quiet,
old-fashioned room, where there were potted
plants at the windows, he waited for Dallas
Gilbert.</p>

<p>When she appeared she was dressed in
white and with a single red rose at her breast.
She held out her hand to him, silently; but
her face was flushed and her eyes were shining.
Never had he seen her more beautiful,
and his admiration must have been plain to
her, for she dropped her eyes quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anna has gone?&#8221; she asked, after they
had seated themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw her and Forrester off in the noon
train,&#8221; answered Kenyon. &#8220;She cried a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
when I told her how you had pleaded for
Forrester with Austin, and she sends her
thanks. She also begs you not to think
harshly of her, nor of him. She said that
neither of them had ever meditated any
wrong against you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure of that,&#8221; replied Dallas. &#8220;I
feel quite sure of it.&#8221; Then, eagerly: &#8220;And
you think they will be happy together!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They love one another very much,&#8221; returned
Kenyon. &#8220;And, in my opinion, that
is everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a brief pause; and then the girl
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you are right, for I wish her all
that is good. We have always been together,
you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are really related, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is my step-sister, and is a few years
younger than myself. When our parents
died, Mr. Austin, who was my father&#8217;s friend,
took us in and cared for us, for we were very
small at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lived with him at Seattle, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not altogether. Mr. Farbush and he were
our joint guardians; most of the time we lived
at the Fifth Avenue house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have thought that life with such a
man as Farbush would have been far from
pleasant.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>&#8220;He was never really unkind until lately.
Indeed, he has always been rather inclined to
be generous. You see he had social pretensions;
he entertained a great deal, and Anna
and I were useful. And, then, all his life Mr.
Farbush has been regarded as a model of
integrity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fancy that you believed this of him and
the others&mdash;at first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Mr. Austin had always been eccentric,
and when, toward the last, he began to
whisper to me of his partners&#8217; plotting
against him, I thought it must be the result of
his age and his illness&mdash;that his suspicions
were imaginings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made a confidante of you, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Always; but especially so during his last
illness. I believe he told me everything, including
the whereabouts of his grandson,
Philip Austin. He always insisted that his
partners would endeavor to accomplish the
death of Philip after he, old Mr. Austin, had
passed away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that Philip&#8217;s cousin, Scott, would come
into the business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It appears that Philip had expressed
himself as being against certain
illegal features of the trade; but Scott had no
such scruples. Indeed, he would have been
more likely to have tried to extend them than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
otherwise. But Mr. Austin would whisper
these things to me; no one ever suspected that
I was so entirely in his confidence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you did not consider the things told
you as being worthy of serious consideration.
That is, you did not really suspect the partners
of wrong doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None but Hong Yo. I disliked him from
the first. Griscom Forrester I always regarded
as honest&mdash;but rather weak. Mr.
Farbush I did not suspect for an instant,
until he denied knowledge of the securities
which Mr. Austin had entrusted to him. It
was then that I first became convinced that
there was really something wrong. I demanded
to be allowed to search the safe in
Mr. Farbush&#8217;s office. He laughed at me, but
I could see that he was astonished at my
knowledge, and frightened also. Then I determined
to appeal to Griscom Forrester. I
followed him one night, that I might have a
chance to speak to him, privately. At Union
Square he began to trail after a man who had
just passed. It was you, and the fact startled
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Kenyon, coolly. &#8220;You
had small confidence in me then.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl flushed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had every reason in the world to hate
you,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>&#8220;I fancied that there was someone following
Forrester and me, that night,&#8221; said
Kenyon, thoughtfully. From his expression
and voice one would have thought that he had
not heard her words. Nevertheless, he had,
and was pondering them.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you turned into that brilliantly
lighted street in the Chinese quarter, I lost
track of you,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;Then suddenly
I came upon the man swathed in bandages,
looking deathly pale and unable to arise from
a doorway into which he had fallen. I was
frightened, but I helped him up, there being
no one else at hand. He was like one demented,
for he kept muttering and vowing
vengeance. Then I caught the names of Farbush
and Forrester, and heard him mention
the house in Selden&#8217;s Square. I questioned
him. In a few moments I knew the outline
of his story, and of that of the others who lay
injured in Bellevue.</p>

<p>&#8220;He said that he was going to the place
called the &#8216;Far East&#8217; to see Hong Yo and
have a settlement. I helped him there, for it
agreed with my plans, and shortly afterwards
we were shown into another building near at
hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did Forrester know that you were
thereabouts?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been accidental.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>&#8220;It was not. He and I were in a rear room
of the &#8216;Far East.&#8217; As I was leaving it, I saw
him go eagerly to a curtained window overlooking
the restaurant; I&#8217;m convinced that he
expected to see you; and was greatly disappointed
at your departure. He immediately
darted from the room by way of the door
leading to the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a pause. Kenyon saw that she
was thinking deeply. Then her face lighted
up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hong Yo must have, in some way, discovered
my presence with the wounded man.
Mr. Forrester may have heard it from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it,&#8221; cried Kenyon. &#8220;He had been
talking with Hong just before. It was after
he returned from this talk that he looked
through the curtains and ran out. In the
midst of his plottings, the blood-horror was
strong upon him. He feared that some harm
would befall you and the man from Butte, and
he was on his way to save you when he disappeared
from the rear room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he did save me&mdash;he and you!&#8221; She
spoke in a lower voice, and he could see a
misty trouble in her eyes. &#8220;Will you forgive
me for what I said that night?&#8221; she pleaded,
softly. &#8220;It was so very, very cruel! It must
have cut you to the heart to have me say such
a thing to you, and at a moment, too, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
you were generously risking, perhaps, your
life to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>did</i> hurt,&#8221; replied he. &#8220;It would be
foolish for me to deny it. But, then, I realized
what your convictions must necessarily
be. And so,&#8221; smiling, &#8220;that eased it, you
see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate, I realized, afterwards, what
you had done for me, and so began to doubt
that you were to be classed among my
enemies. When I opened the packet of
securities that night, after snatching them
from you in front of the safe, I found some
letters with your name signed to them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes,&#8221; said Kenyon with interest.
&#8220;So you saw them, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was something about them, I don&#8217;t
know what, that caused me to distrust them.
That night when you came to the Club, in
Mulberry Street, a way of convincing myself
as to this suddenly occurred to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You asked me to write my name in a
book,&#8221; said Kenyon, quietly. &#8220;I remember
wondering about that at the time. I was
quite confident though that you had a secret
motive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The writing was not the same!&#8221; she cried,
in triumph. &#8220;It was nothing at all like that
of the letters. And so,&#8221; with a laugh, &#8220;I was
then sure that&mdash;that you had not written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>
them&mdash;that someone had used your name,
that you had spoken the truth that night in
the cab when you denied all knowledge of the
Austin affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever!&#8221; commented Kenyon.</p>

<p>He watched the play of the lights in her
brilliant face. When she smiled, her teeth
seemed perfection; and her eyes fairly set
him dreaming.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was pleased,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Indeed, I was
quite delighted. And yet I was frightened.
I could not altogether&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated painfully, now; so Kenyon
finished the sentence for her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You could not altogether trust me,&#8221; said
he, good-naturedly. &#8220;But that was only
natural. One seldom trusts, at the outset,
persons whom one has suspected of affiliation
with the enemy. It&#8217;s a sort of military instinct.
Perhaps you get it from an ancestor,
who may have been a soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed at this.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you must have thought me a most
unaccountable person, all along!&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;Even to the very end I no doubt seemed a
sort of fay, appearing so strangely, as I did.
Take the incident of a few nights ago at the
old house outside South Norwalk, for example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was astonished when you darted out so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
suddenly. But I had an intimation that some
unlooked-for person was on the ground, before
us. One of Forrester&#8217;s men saw, or
heard, you in the road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard his signal,&#8221; said Dallas, &#8220;and oh,
I was so frightened. But I hid myself and
did not answer; later I stole away up the
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you walk all that distance; it
was a good five miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dreaded attracting attention by engaging
a carriage. I thought Forrester might
have someone on the watch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His watchers were scarcely trustworthy,&#8221;
said Kenyon, grimly. &#8220;You need not have
been afraid. He must have instructed some
of them to be on hand if his visitors offered
him violence; but they failed him. I had no
trouble about entering the house secretly; and
I suppose you had none, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; and when I heard Anna and Mr. Forrester
approaching the room that I had entered,
I hid in a sort of closet that was at the
upper end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! that was when you went tip-toeing so
cautiously across the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You did not see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but Austin did. But, of course, he
did not know who you were. But, tell me:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
How did you learn that Forrester had gone
to that particular place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The young man from Saginaw telephoned
me. You see, I had left word with him to
keep me informed as to anything that he
might discover.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, of course! I remember, now,
his telling me of that, at the Hotel Suisse.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a short silence. He was looking
at her, and there was the same question in his
eyes that had been there in one form or another
ever since he had first seen her that
night in the hansom cab. All the other problems
that the case had presented, he had
approached with a native and nonchalant
boldness. But as he came to this one, he was
aware of a strange timorousness, a quick,
short thumping of the heart, an odd lack of
control of the situation that was most unusual.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a thing,&#8221; said he, with a little
effort, &#8220;that has had me wondering since our
first meeting. I have often thought it over,
but could never make anything of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>There is nothing more certain in the world
than an agitated mind&#8217;s communicating its
unrest to a neighboring one that is in any
way sensitive. This was now plainly the
case. She instinctively seized the thought before
he had put it into words; the rich color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
flooded her face; her heavy, dark lashes hid
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why were you so scornful that night?&#8221;
asked he, leaning toward her. &#8220;But no!
When I come to think of it, it was not scorn,
really; it was contempt!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, please!&#8221; she begged, lifting her eyes,
imploringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; insisted he. &#8220;There was a reason
for it. You had never seen me before.
And it could hardly have been a sudden
aversion. It was too complete for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color was still deep in her face; her
slim hands were clasping and unclasping
nervously. But while her voice was low and
her manner confused, her eyes were brave.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was because of your friend, Balmacenso.
When Mr. Austin wrote the letter
urging you to come to New York, the man
answered asking what was to be his&mdash;his
reward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your guardian replied&mdash;?&#8221; eagerly.</p>

<p>If it were possible the exquisite color in her
cheeks deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sent Anna&#8217;s portrait, and mine. He
offered either of us in marriage. To give
him peace we had consented to this. I&mdash;I
was the one selected; but the reward was,
apparently, not great enough for Balmacenso.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>&#8220;Not great enough!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wanted money as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The truth flashed upon Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;And that was his price&mdash;that check that
you gave me in the cab?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered, almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>His eyes searched her face for a space.
Heavens! Balmacenso must have been a fool
as well as a knave.</p>

<p>&#8220;What sort of a portrait of you was it that
was sent him?&#8221; asked Kenyon.</p>

<p>&#8220;A very good one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It couldn&#8217;t have been,&#8221; disagreed he,
briefly.</p>

<p>Then he took a folded slip of paper from
his pocket. Opening it he said: &#8220;Then Hong
Yo signed the checks for Austin &amp; Co.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either he or Mr. Forrester.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kenyon touched one end of the slip to a
flame that shot up from the grate. In an instant
the check was in ashes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_292.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">KENYON TOUCHED ONE END OF THE SLIP TO A FLAME</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anything to boot,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;You are enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She was upon her feet quickly,
startled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; He, also, arose, and stood before
her, very calmly, and quite master of himself
once more. &#8220;The man who so deceived your
guardian and impersonated me was an unscrupulous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
villain. But he showed a taste
that I would not have credited him with.&#8221;</p>

<p>She made an involuntary movement away
from him; he put out his hand as though to
touch her, but let it fall without doing so.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not often,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that a man has
another select his wife for him, and without
his knowing anything about it.&#8221; He waited
for an answer; but as none came he proceeded:
&#8220;But more seldom still, when it does
occur, is the right girl selected.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he paused, and still there was silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not have allowed this man to
select a sword blade for me. I would not
have had sufficient confidence in him. And
yet he has selected for me the one woman in
the world whom I would make my wife.&#8221; One
step took him to her side, and he looked down
into her face. &#8220;Will you?&#8221; asked he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;are you sure that you want
me?&#8221; she whispered.</p>

<p>And the next instant she was in his arms
and his first kiss was upon her lips.</p>

(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
